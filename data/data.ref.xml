<ami:content>DUBLIN, April 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The &quot;Asia&apos;s Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Market to 2026 - Stressed Landfills Boosting Growth Opportunities&quot; report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com&apos;s offering. 

This study looks into the WtE market in Asia, with a particular focus on waste incinerators and gasifiers. The main countries/regions covered in this study are China, India, East Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan), and Southeast Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines).

This study calculates the total and regional Asian market for WtE in 2019 and forecasts it to 2026. This study also calculates and forecasts the market for incineration and gasification systems. The markets have been shown in terms of CapEx revenues as well as in terms of new WtE projects. The study talks about the various drivers and restraints that affect the market in Asia, and also points out the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market.

The study looks into the key competitors in the market across the region and estimates their market shares. Some of the companies mentioned in this study include the Hitachi Zosen Corporation, China Everbright International, Keppel Seghers, CNIM Martin, Veolia, and Suez.

Finally, the study provides a detailed list of growth opportunities in the market, including advanced digital solutions, the integration of WtE with other circular economy elements, and some improved business models for WtE companies to explore.

Market Insights

Asia&apos;s large population and rapid urbanization have led to vast amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation. Estimated at more than one million tonnes per day, MSW generation in urban Asia is only expected to increase in the coming years. Managing this waste is becoming a problem, with landfilling fast fading as a viable option, since land availability is decreasing and the landfills are filling up much before their intended active lifespans.
Waste-to-energy (WtE), or energy-from-waste (EfW) as it is also commonly called, is a means of waste management that burns unrecyclable waste and converts it into electricity and heat for further use. It is generally used in cities to convert municipal solid waste into electricity and district heating. The residues generated from WtE are generally sent to landfills and account for more than a 95% volume reduction to them. Nowadays, WtE companies are also finding new uses of these residues to try to ensure that almost no waste goes to landfills. This also acts as an additional source of income.
A circular economy works on the premise that virtually no waste moves out of the current system (no landfilling ideally) and all end-of-life products are reused, repurposed, recycled or have their energy recovered. This principle is gaining greater acceptance in Asia, with countries like Japan, China, India, and Singapore developing their own strategies in order to transition into a circular economy. Many of them are also seeing WtE as their main way of energy recovery from unrecyclable waste.

<ami:content>Un tracteur bleu électrique, surmonté d&apos;un haut-parleur crachant ses chants militants, bat le rappel à travers le village de Makrauli, dans le nord de l&apos;Inde, pour collecter des dons de lait destinés aux agriculteurs qui manifestent depuis près de trois mois aux portes de Delhi.

Depuis la fin novembre, des dizaines de milliers d&apos;agriculteurs sont installés sur les routes menant à la capitale indienne pour manifester leur opposition aux réformes gouvernementales qui libéralisent les marchés agricoles et dont ils exigent l&apos;abrogation pure et simple. 

Ces fermiers ont traversé l&apos;hiver dans des campements de fortune par un froid glacial, avec le soutien d&apos;une multitude de villages des Etats du nord de l&apos;Inde, avoisinant la capitale, et dont ils sont, pour la plupart, originaires.

&quot;Ce mouvement agricole n&apos;est pas seulement celui de ceux qui font le siège là-bas&quot;, affirme à l&apos;AFP Sumit Arya, 35 ans, le chef du village de Makrauli Khurd dans l&apos;Haryana, à deux heures de route des principaux campements. &quot;C&apos;est notre mouvement à nous tous, habitants des zones rurales.&quot; 

Chaque matin, dans ce village de 4.000 âmes, hommes et femmes se dépêchent d&apos;apporter légumes et bois dans les points de collecte.

Le mardi est dédié aux dons de lait frais que les villageois transportent sur des carrioles, dans des petits pots de fer, juste après la traite des vaches. Ensuite des hommes, à l&apos;instar de Ajit Singh, les transvasent dans de grands bidons pour les acheminer aux manifestants.

&quot;Nous ne pouvons pas leur donner notre temps, mais nous pouvons les approvisionner en nourriture et en eau, fournir tout ce qui leur est nécessaire en hiver&quot;, déclare à l&apos;AFP le fermier de 58 ans, assis sur une meule de paille, dans une carriole.

Derrière, quelqu&apos;un lance un des cris de ralliement des manifestants &quot;kisan ekta&quot; (&quot;Fermiers unis&quot;) et aussitôt des villageois lèvent leur poing et entonnent le chant &quot;zindabad&quot; (&quot;longue vie&quot;).

Leur mouvement constitue l&apos;un des plus grands défis auxquels le gouvernement du Premier ministre Narendra Modi a été confronté depuis son arrivée au pouvoir en 2014.

Les réformes votées en septembre autorisent les agriculteurs à vendre leurs productions aux acheteurs de leur choix, plutôt que de se tourner exclusivement vers les marchés contrôlés par l&apos;État qui leur assurent un prix de soutien minimal (PSM) pour certaines denrées.

Nombre de petits exploitants agricoles s&apos;estiment désormais menacés par cette libéralisation qui, selon eux, risque de les obliger à brader leurs marchandises aux grandes entreprises pour les écouler. 

Le poids du secteur agricole est considérable, assurant la subsistance de près de 70% de 1,3 milliard d&apos;habitants, et contribuant à environ 15% du PIB. 

- &quot;Sans cette fraternité, rien ne marche&quot;-

Depuis le début des manifestations, un réseau de solidarité s&apos;est mis en place. Chaque jour des tracteurs aux carrioles chargées de bois et de vivres quittent des villages comme Makrauli à destination des campements aux portes de Delhi. 

Des fermiers et leurs familles les accompagnent. &quot;Deux ou trois tracteurs de notre village vont soutenir le moral&quot; des manifestants, explique à l&apos;AFP Ajay Punia, 18 ans, juché avec onze villageois, âgés de 14 à 65 ans, sur la carriole qui s&apos;ébranle.

Le drapeau vert et jaune du syndicat des agriculteurs et les couleurs de l&apos;Inde flottent ensemble sur le tracteur, tandis que résonnent des chants de la résistance paysanne.

Plus tard, le convoi est rejoint par deux chariots transportant une trentaine de personnes, des femmes pour la plupart. On se salue poing en l&apos;air et les chants repartent de plus belle. 

Le long de l&apos;autoroute, les gens leur font signe de la main.

Parvenu au grand campement de Tikri en banlieue de Delhi, halte est faite à la cantine communautaire, les hommes vont s&apos;asseoir en ligne sur un tapis où des femmes leur servent un curry de pois et de pommes de terre, accompagné d&apos;un roti (galette) et d&apos;une tasse de lait frais de Makrauli.

&quot;Sans cette fraternité, rien ne marche. Même dans notre village, différentes castes y participent&quot;, dit Arya. &quot;Les gens s&apos;engagent de plus en plus (...) Nous ne reculons pas.&quot;

<ami:content>Cette rencontre intervient à l&apos;heure où les efforts se multiplient pour aboutir à un accord de paix avant le 1er mai lorsque les Etats-Unis doivent théoriquement retirer tous leurs militaires d&apos;Afghanistan. Mais cette date a été remise en cause mercredi par le président Joe Biden.  

Washington a proposé aux belligérants afghans la formation d&apos;un gouvernement de transition incluant les talibans. Cette idée, soutenue par Moscou, a pour l&apos;instant reçu un accueil peu enthousiaste de la part du pouvoir à Kaboul.  

A Moscou, le co-fondateur du mouvement taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a appelé à laisser les Afghans &quot;décider de leur propre sort&quot;. &quot;Le monde devrait prendre en compte les valeurs islamiques, l&apos;indépendance et les intérêts nationaux du peuple afghan&quot;, a indiqué sur Twitter un porte-parole, résumant un discours à huis clos.

Le chef du conseil de réconciliation du gouvernement afghan, Abdullah Abdullah, a déclaré de son côté que Kaboul souhaitait accélérer les négociations et que &quot;les deux parties entament leurs pourparlers et discussions dans une atmosphère différente&quot; que celle de Doha, au Qatar.  

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, autre membre de la délégation du gouvernement afghan, a estimé que la rencontre de jeudi à Moscou avait permis de sortir de l&apos;&quot;impasse&quot; les négociations avec les talibans.  

Après avoir reçu les différentes délégations, le ministre russe des Affaires étrangères, Sergueï Lavrov, a appelé Washington et les talibans à &quot;rester attachés aux dispositions de l&apos;accord&quot; conclu par l&apos;administration de l&apos;ex-président Donald Trump en février 2020 au Qatar.  

Cet accord prévoit le retrait des soldats américains d&apos;ici au 1er mai 2021 en échange de garanties sécuritaires et d&apos;un engagement des talibans à discuter avec Kaboul.  

Mais le nouveau président des Etats-Unis, Joe Biden, a estimé mercredi qu&apos;il serait &quot;difficile&quot; de tenir ce délai et les talibans l&apos;ont aussitôt mis en garde contre tout retard.  

Les discussions à Moscou, qui se tiennent en présence d&apos;émissaires pakistanais, chinois et américain, sont organisées parallèlement à celles qui ont commencé en septembre à Doha, au Qatar, et à celles que la Turquie veut accueillir en avril à Istanbul.  

M. Lavrov a dit &quot;regretter que les efforts déployés pour lancer le processus politique à Doha n&apos;aient pas encore donné de résultats&quot; et espérer que les discussions à Moscou &quot;contribueront à créer les conditions nécessaires&quot; à des progrès.  

Il a souligné que &quot;dans les conditions d&apos;une situation militaro-politique qui se dégrade, de nouveaux retards sont inacceptables&quot; pour les négociations à Doha.  

Les violences se sont intensifiées ces derniers mois dans tout l&apos;Afghanistan, malgré les pourparlers. Dans ce contexte, le départ des Etats-Unis inquiète le gouvernement en place à Kaboul, dont l&apos;autorité est contestée ou mise à mal sur plus de la moitié du territoire.

<ami:content>User experience design is highly dynamic, echoing uncertainty and value conflict in the problematic experiences in which we designers engage in. Our design inquiries are often through lived experiences, and for that reason, our role and responsibilities are critical to design. Our engagement determines the nature of the problem’s resolution but also explores the nature of the problem.

A fully understood problem is only as good as the designers interpreting it. To simply say that we are purposefully finding the user needs is a simplification. People’s thoughts, actions, and their problematic experience breathe within the frame of its situation.

We should, to the extent possible, experience and describe the situation that is being designed for as it may only be understood in its own larger frame. To interpret or empathise/sense with problematic situations that are foreign to us. To tell the untold. And to discover and articulate desires and tensions that are unresolved or unfulfilled.

People’s problems and desires are often not directly apparent to us in our inquiries. Such problems hold dimensions that can not simply be comprehensible through linear steps of methods and activities.

They are unstable and unique, often wicked imbued with implicit meanings, which require us to be more. To encompass a reflective practice and critical thinking in order to interpret those meanings through participation, observations, interviews, documents, etc.

It is often other people’s problems that we work with and therefore we have to explore and understand people, situations, places, practices that we are not familiar with. This is why we engage in lived experiences, or situations, where people’s problems reside, to live their world.

How people interact can offer more insight than how they account for it. From this perspective, we are embodied inquiries explicating people’s experiences and their implicit meanings.

We are embodied inquirers who delve into the present in order to design for the future. And often only through engagement may we fully understand the problem and the world in which it arises, shaping it and rendering it meaningful.

Here, we are not spectators but designers who experiment in a continuum between knowing and doing and are therefore dependent on critical thinking and interpretation. This hands-on interaction with first-hand accounts of experiences, back and forth, fuels our design process to attempt one framing and reframing after another.

The whys, hows, and whats 
We interpret through critical thinking. Whilst critical thinking brings intention, motivation, and rationale for the unfolding of our inquiry, our design intentions are supported by reflection on the why’s and how’s. We can think of it as explicating or unpacking.

What is said, or done, and the experiences that are imbued with deeper meanings. Why? How? What?

Critical thinking allows us to pose thoughtful questions, elicit a fruitful response and design organically. It provides reasoning and arguments for our design choices and widens our understanding, seeking as much precision as the situation requires.

Such acts often uncover further tensions and uncertainties which form the basis of new questions to purposefully resolve. These questions tend to draw us closer to the future experience, the intended use situation.

One part of critical thinking is asking for clarification and/or challenging questions. Not succumb to uninterpreted findings but questioning them to gain richer understandings of the situation which allows us to rethink our evaluation criteria.

Why is the person expressing a particular tension? What does the particular tension mean? What would be an example? What would not be an example? How does this? How so? What is the person not telling us? What are the underlying meanings? What is actually being expressed? Why, why, and why?

This constant critical thinking and reflection shaping us toward particular outcomes is what moves the situation from multiple possibilities toward a set of actual possibilities. Careful and mindful actions allow us to determine which ends should be achieved and which should be discouraged.

<ami:content>&quot;Nous faisons nos adieux à notre leader&quot;, a déclaré le président Ramaphosa, se souvenant de Zwelithini comme d&apos;un &quot;défenseur acharné de son peuple&quot; qui &quot;appréciait la diversité&quot; et respectait les autres cultures. &quot;C&apos;est un jour difficile car un grand arbre est tombé&quot;.  

- Mort du Covid? - 
Le chef de l&apos;Etat a laissé entendre que le roi Zwelithini luttait contre le Covid-19 au moment de sa mort.  

&quot;Notre leader et roi bien-aimé... a succombé à la maladie mortelle qui a emporté la vie de tant de personnes&quot;, a-t-il dit, sans nommer le virus.  

Pendant tout son discours, M. Ramaphosa est passé de l&apos;anglais au zoulou, rendant ainsi hommage à la langue la plus répandue parmi la douzaine de langues officielles de l&apos;Afrique du Sud. Il y a plus de 11 millions de Zoulous en Afrique du Sud, soit près d&apos;un cinquième de la population du pays.  

Parmi les invités figuraient notamment l&apos;ancien président Jacob Zuma, membre de l&apos;ethnie zouloue, le président nouvellement élu de la Confédération africaine de football Patrice Motsepe et la princesse Charlène de Monaco,installés sur des chaises à bonne distance les unes des autres, afin de respecter les mesures sanitaires en vigueur.  

Les six épouses du roi étaient installées au premier rang, des voiles de dentelle noire recouvrant leurs têtes.  

Le roi a été &quot;planté&quot; dans la terre dans la nuit, au cours d&apos;une cérémonie intime.  

Alors que le pays est affecté depuis une semaine par des coupures d&apos;électricité quotidiennes, d&apos;une durée de plusieurs heures, la compagnie Eskom a annoncé, dans un communiqué mercredi soir, que l&apos;électricité serait maintenue jeudi de 10h à 14h, afin que tous les Sud-Africains puissent regarder la cérémonie d&apos;obsèques à la télévision et porter &quot;le deuil du roi&quot;.  

Tôt dans la matinée, des groupes de dizaines de jeunes femmes, en tenue traditionnelle, mini-jupes aux couleurs vives, seins nus et masquées, ont chanté et dansé devant le palais royal zoulou.   

Elles ont déroulé une banderole proclamant &quot;Longue vie à Sa Majesté&quot;. Les hommes, en tenue de guerriers - peaux de léopard recouvrant leur torse, bandeau, boucliers et lance en main, ont dansé aussi, levant haut la jambe pour frapper à terre, selon la tradition zouloue.  

Descendant du légendaire Chaka, fondateur du royaume au début du XIXe siècle, Goodwill Zwelithini, 8e roi des Zoulous, a régné pendant 50 ans.  

Aussi vénéré que controversé, Goodwill Zwelithini était notamment connu à l&apos;étranger pour ses propos outranciers sur les migrants, les homosexuels, ou pour avoir rétabli dans les années 1980 l&apos;Umhlanga, une danse annuelle de jeunes vierges aux seins nus.  

&quot;Il l&apos;a fait par amour&quot;, explique Nhlanhla Magwaza, 24 ans, l&apos;une de ces &quot;jeunes filles&quot;, venue de la ville voisine d&apos;Ulundi pour lui rendre hommage.  

Zwelithini a été également accusé d&apos;avoir fait le jeu du système d&apos;apartheid, au crépuscule de la domination de la minorité blanche dans les années 1990, en luttant contre l&apos;African National Congress (ANC) de Nelson Mandela, alors interdit par les autorités.  

En tant que chef traditionnel particulièrement influent, il a conseillé les législateurs et rencontré des hommes politiques puissants tout au long de son règne.  

Charismatique et à la langue acérée, le roi a été aussi loué pour avoir dissipé certaines dangereuses légendes et fables entourant le VIH/sida, dans un pays alors frappé de plein fouet par cette épidémie.  

Le nom de son successeur reste pour l&apos;instant inconnu. Il aurait dû être normalement remplacé par le fils aîné de la première de ses épouses, avec laquelle il a eu 28 enfants. Mais ce premier fils a été assassiné en novembre dernier à l&apos;âge de 50 ans dans sa maison de Johannesburg.  

Selon l&apos;historien local Khaya Ndwandwe, la désignation d&apos;un successeur pourrait prendre deux ans. &quot;Il y a certains rituels qui doivent être accomplis&quot;, a-t-il expliqué, notamment la &quot;purification&quot; des épouses et du palais, ainsi que l&apos;abattage du bétail.

<ami:content>Many design trends posts act like art directors — practically guiding your hands on the mouse. This year, we’re doing trends different, by focusing on what actually matters. From accessibility to truth, no-code to role, these are the web design trends to focus on if your definition of beauty includes functionality, accessibility, and psychological safety.

Web design’s biggest trends for 2020 
Each year, I share my take on the web design trends that will shape the coming year, often incorporating the opinions of my fellow designers at Webflow, as well as those of well-known names in the broader design community. I’ve always included a mix of concrete design details and interaction models as well as higher-level concepts, which helped fill out my self-imposed constraint of adding one more trend than the number of the year (19 web design trends for 2018, for example).

This year, I’m breaking the mold.

Because 2020 is going to be a different year for design, to my mind. A year when we’re all going to focus a little less on this layout, that color scheme, and whichever nifty animation mode caught our eye last week, and instead consider the deeper underlying concerns of design.

So I’m ditching the same ole design specifics we see year after year (broken grids, anyone?!) to focus on the bigger picture. To ask far more significant questions like:

- How do we design to make information clear, while still making it easily consumable?
- How do we make design universal, ensuring that no one feels excluded or erased by our decisions?
- And, perhaps most significantly, how will a new generation of tools, built upon a paradigm that’s simultaneously brand-new, yet old as spreadsheets, change not only the way we work, but also what we produce?

But more on that last point later. Let’s dive into the 9 web design trends we’ll see in 2020:

1. Designing truth 
It’s no secret that we’ve entered what many are calling the “post-truth” era, with myriad instances of deepfakes, misinformation campaigns, and outright lies popping up, gaining viral traction, and ultimately shaping the decision-making of millions — all too often driven by prominent individuals who will here go unnamed.

The major social media platforms have each come out with policies — and in some cases, designs — to account for this new flourishing of untruths.

Facebook has decided that it simply won’t intervene with political untruths . To support its stance, the platform has cited everything from the First Amendment to the FCC’s similar stance on political advertising on the TV. Conveniently forgetting that it is neither a) the government (the one that’s actually restricted from censorship by freedom of speech) nor b) the increasingly anachronistic technology that is television.

Facebook’s been (apparently) trying to combat fake news on its platform since 2015, doing so in classic Silicon Valley iterative design style. It first tried to encourage individual users to flag content as “false news” — an odd half-borrowing from President Trump — then by marking some stories as “disputed” — which, according to what it called “academic” research, backfired by reinforcing some users’ belief in the content — then, most recently overlaying the content with a straightforward notice reading:

False Information

Checked by independent fact-checkers.

(Side-by-side comparison of how Facebook and Instagram use an overlay to obscure “false information”)   (Side-by-side comparison of how Facebook and Instagram use an overlay to obscure “false information”)   
Source: The Verge The overlay also provides a prominent CTA to view the fact-checkers’s findings — as well as a secondary button to go ahead and view the false content.

At present, there’s still no plan to flag paid political posts as false.

One interesting thing to note is that Facebook started trying to remedy sharing of false information only after it was shared — the original poster was given no alerts to the fact that the content they wanted to share was disputed. They’ve amended this in subsequent designs to be more proactive in alerting the original sharer — but it’s still intriguing that the notifications focus on the fact that there’s “additional reporting” on the content.

This strategy focuses on encouraging what we call “curiosity clicks.” This encourages engagement with the information, but that’s also its flaw: you have to care enough that there’s “additional reporting” to click through. As a content designer, I have to wonder if it wouldn’t be more effective to name the fact checkers and pull a significant quote on the content. Snopes, for example, does a great job of highlighting what the specific claim is and giving it a straightforward “true” or “false” (with a range of fuzziness between) rating.

(Screenshot of Snopes article on U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet of his own head on Rocky’s body. It’s true.)   
(Screenshot of Snopes article on U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet of his own head on Rocky’s body. It’s true.)   (Screenshot of Snopes article on U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet of his own head on Rocky’s body. It’s true.)   
Yep, he actually did do that.Twitter has taken a rather more straightforward (and cheerworthy) stance of simply disallowing political advertising on its platform. Though as many people have commented, it’s just not that easy. All kinds of misinformation “earns” its way into our feeds daily, a reality that Twitter seems to have done little to nothing to address.

In the end, what really matters here is not so much what the major platforms are doing to bring clarity and trustworthiness to their platforms, but what you might do to bring more of that into your own work.

Here are a few thoughts on doing that:

Label more prominently and clearly 
(Sponsored article section of Slate’s homepage.)   
(Sponsored article section of Slate’s homepage.)   (Sponsored article section of Slate’s homepage.)   
5 ads. Not labeled as such.In a 2016 report on a Stanford study of students’ ability to determine the veracity of information found online, the Wall Street Journal stated:

Some 82% of middle-schoolers couldn’t distinguish between an ad labeled “sponsored content” and a real news story on a website, according to a Stanford University study of 7,804 students from middle school through college.

Much of the “optimization” of ad formats like “sponsored content” has gone into … well, hiding the fact that they’re ads. Just look at the name: “sponsored content.” On a content-driven site, that simply implies that the content was “sponsored” by someone, much as race car drivers are sponsored by various corporations.

The reality, of course, is that these are ads, even if they’re not as direct as banners. And we should label them as such.

And it’s not just our language that could be clearer. Our design work could use some improvements too. Just look at the screenshot above (taken on Dec 3, 2019). Every single story in that shot is a piece of sponsored content, hosted on a different website, but seamlessly integrated into Slate’s own homepage.

(News &amp; Politics section of Slate’s homepage)   
(News &amp; Politics section of Slate’s homepage)   (News &amp; Politics section of Slate’s homepage)   
Compare the labeling of this “real news” section to that on the sponsored content section above.The title font for the native news articles and the sponsored stories is the same. But note what’s quite different: the font size and location of the “author.” In the native stories, the author’s name is set reasonably large, above the title. You definitely still see the title first, but the author name cries out for your attention in these real stories.

The sponsored posts, on the other hand? The “author” — or brand, actually — is set much smaller. The fact that the “author” is listed as a brand, rather than as an individual writing for the brand, is telling as well: While we have someone to follow up with (or blame or praise) for real reporting, the sponsored stories are attributed to faceless brands.

Perhaps even more significantly: note that the real articles are practically emblazoned with a category title (e.g., News &amp; Politics). The sponsored stories? Oddly lacking that prominent header.

Make sources more obvious 
In the world of journalism, you’ll often hear the mantra:

Consider the source.

Which is not something most students do these days, according to the study:

Many students judged the credibility of newsy tweets based on how much detail they contained or whether a large photo was attached, rather than on the source.

And while that maxim is stressed to young and aspiring journos as a core practice, it could also help us designers help the rest of the world out. What if, for example, every organization’s Twitter profile included a link to their Wikipedia page, or a Google search of their name? What if publications featured an about page that clarified their political stance, history, management, and funding sources? One better: what if they linked to independent commentators on the publication?

These, of course, are just ideas — if nothing else, prompts to consider more deeply how we might encourage readers to act more like journalists and consider their sources in a more objective manner.

But we can also consider carefully the criteria young students are using to evaluate credibility, and encourage our social media teams to make updates information-dense, and pair them with large, engaging graphics.

Finally, and to bring this closer to home for web designers crafting publishing experiences (that is, any designer who works on a site with a blog, case studies, etc.): consider making your authors and their credentials much more obvious in your content-driven experiences. This can not only boost your site’s credibility and give readers a point of contact, but also arm readers to better evaluate your authors’ content. A thoughtfully curated list of contributors then becomes a marketing asset, akin to the list of blurbs on every mass-market book cover.

Use “related content” to provide context and contrast 
Related content — a familiar content pattern often appearing in the middle or at the end of blog posts and news articles, often under a heading like “You might also like…” — gives designers a powerful tool for adding easily accessible nuance to a reader’s understanding of a topic.

How? By ensuring two things:

- That opinion pieces are contextualized by the stories they comment on, or by contrasting opinions
- That news stories get additional color through the opinion pieces through the pieces that comment on them

Using related content to provide extra context on fact- and opinion-based pieces helps work against our age’s increasingly obvious preference for “bite-sized” information. Bite-sized data helps us quickly get a basic understanding of issues in a world fraught with issues — but it also means that we often lack a nuanced understanding of said issues.

When we rely solely on our favorite “influencers’” hot-takes on Twitter, we start to look a lot like a pitchfork-and-torch wielding mob, all too ready to take one charismatic voice for the font of truth. But the more that content creators and designers can point readers to extra information and contrasting opinions, the more we can encourage nuanced understandings that rely more on information and reason than on emotion.

- Label your content types clearly to help readers create a mental model of your content and better distinguish between organic and promotional materials
- Contextualize and promote your sources so readers know where your content comes from and can better evaluate its credibility
- Use related content to add context and promote nuanced understandings of topics

All the above said, it’s worth remembering that misinformation isn’t a fixed target, a fact captured beautifully by Tom Rosenstiel, director of the American Press Institute and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution:

Whatever changes platform companies make, and whatever innovations fact checkers and other journalists put in place, those who want to deceive will adapt to them. Misinformation is not like a plumbing problem you fix. It is a social condition, like crime, that you must constantly monitor and adjust to. Since as far back as the era of radio and before, as Winston Churchill said, ‘A lie can go around the world before the truth gets its pants on.’

Which is to say: if you want to play a role in fighting misinformation in 2020, prepare for the long haul, and be ready to update your strategies and tactics as the information landscape continues to change.

2. Accessibility is (finally) key 
Before I dive in here, I have to offer a confession on behalf of Webflow: We did not build Webflow with accessibility in mind. But we’ve recently hired two accessibility specialists and formed a team around the effort to make accessibility a first-class citizen in Webflow. Stay tuned for more on that.

Web accessibility — the practice of ensuring that websites and web applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities — has long been a vital part of the web design and development process in mature organizations. Particularly in governmental and publicly funded institutions, where Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance has long been a legal requirement.

But with high-profile cases like the Domino’s lawsuit and others gaining broad notice, the writing is on the wall: soon, all websites will be required to meet ADA requirements — making accessibility a compliance issue, not just a “nice to have.”

And while I don’t want to overplay the impact this will have on our profession — as numerous relatively minor interventions in our processes and skillsets will have significant impact on the accessibility of our products — I don’t think we can afford to underplay this fact either. Because while relatively small efforts will have significant impact, the changes required of us to make more accessible sites will affect literally every step of the design process, and the workflows of every participant in that process.

Don’t believe me? Check out Vox’s accessibility checklist , which outlines the ways every web professional, from designers to QAs to editors, can contribute to building more accessible websites and applications.

But the work of accessibility requires far more than checklists and automated checks via browser plugins. Because much of the work of accessible website design can’t be checked via software. And because web design, outside of web app development, is essentially all about publishing, accessible web design means reconsidering the ways we publish too. If we create videos for the web, we need to consider captioning, transcripts, and other non-visual equivalents we can offer. If we host podcasts, we’ll need to think about how we can make our content available to those with low or non-existent hearing. If we publish infographics and charts, we’ll need to think about how we can make the content of these mediums available to those who can’t see them.

And designers, long used to relying on visual formats and low-contrast aesthetics to do their work, will have to stretch to account for this more inclusive paradigm. We’ll have to think long and hard about the limitations of visual formats not only for the differently abled, but for those for whom visuals aren’t nearly as transparently legible as they are to designers (myself included!).

Blind spots abound in the design process, and these holes are often based on our disciplines. As a writer, I often find it difficult to account for those with a less broad vocabulary, as well as those who prefer visual formats. (Even the turn of phrase I opened this paragraph with could be seen as ableist.) Designers, similarly, tend to overlook the value and power of a single sentence, especially when paired with an equally powerful visual.

The reality is: we learned our skills in a context that assumed there was such a thing as a “normal.” That you could apply your skills to communicate to “everyone” in your preferred format because “most people” can process your preferred format just fine.

Disability can be permanent, temporary, or situational. Source: Microsoft Inclusive Design But the fact is that is much as 26% of the United States’ population experiences some form of disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And as Microsoft has so eloquently communicated via their inclusive design content, 100% of the population may experience temporary or situational disabilities. And the fact is that none of us are getting any younger, and the older we get, the higher the chance we’ll experience a more or less permanent disability becomes.

There is no health; physicians say that we
At best enjoy but a neutrality.

–John Donne, “An Anatomy of the World,” 1611

The world (and its advertising) may turn around the healthy and young, but we can no longer afford to design solely for them.

3. Content gets its due in web and product design 
I’ve been a content professional working on the web since 2006, and in those (almost) 14 years, one debate has defined my experience of the profession:

Does design or content come first?

This so-called debate has never failed to flummox me, for several reasons. And it’s incredibly relieving to me to see that designers are increasingly coming to understand what has always seemed obvious to me: that the “content,” or rather, the “message,” has to come before the design. Because, otherwise, there’s literally nothing to design.

On the other hand, this debate is confusing and frustrating because, in reality, it’s not even the real question. Neither content nor design come first. Because you really can’t create content or design till you have a strategy. And you can’t have a strategy until you have a goal: a purpose that the thing you want to publish should fulfill.

To clarify this, I like to point back to web design and publishing’s predecessor: print publishing. Before you can design a book, you need a book to design. And before you can write a book, you need a point: an idea or truth that you wish to convey to your audience.

It’s important to point out here that a website is not, in fact, a book. Its material expression, functionality, and distribution are vastly different than a book. But in terms of purpose, a book and a website are very much the same: they both exist to convey information to an audience. (No, I’m not talking about web apps here.*)

The core difference is that the website hopes to gather some information from its audience in exchange for the information (or functionality) it offers: typically, an email, that uniquely modern key to an individual’s identity, and to communication with that person.

But to get, you have to give. You need to offer some value, and even the teams behind the world’s most popular digital products realize that quality content makes for an incredible source of value, allowing you to draw the attention of even those your product (isn’t yet) for.

Of course, content isn’t just blog posts. (Nor is it just words, but that’s a whole other post.) Content also plays a key role in your product’s overall user experience, and increasingly, platforms are feeling the pain of getting content wrong.

Here’s an example I ran across just the other day, on LinkedIn (where I once worked, for transparency):

(“Is this information correct?” modal on LinkedIn.com)   
(“Is this information correct?” modal on LinkedIn.com)   (“Is this information correct?” modal on LinkedIn.com)   
Notice anything? I sure do! And I could go on and on about the flaws of this interface, but I’ll restrict myself to the single most important one:

What the heck do I do if that’s not my “correct” or “active” email address?

I’m being asked to take action on this information if necessary, but there’s no obvious way for me to do anything but “remove” my phone number! The content and the interface are completely misaligned, ensuring that — at best — LinkedIn might get an accurate, current phone number from me.

But, ironically, what this UI does best for me, the user, is to remind me that LinkedIn has my phone number (why tho?!) and, better yet, give me a chance to dissociate it from my profile. (I originally wrote “delete it from their database,” but a colleague rightly pointed out … it almost certainly doesn’t do that.)

I’m just going to guess that wasn’t their goal.

But I’m not here to complain about LinkedIn’s content. I’m here to stress the centrality of content to the overall user experience of any digital environment. Hopefully the above does the trick, but to reinforce my point, here are a few content-related highs and lows from 2019:

Tone can make or break a relationship. 
I don’t, personally, share Alicia’s praise here. That pun on Alaska is … rough. 
Most telling, perhaps, is the increasing prominence of content strategy and UX writing in the brands of some of today’s most recognizable brands. Just look to the design publications and publicly-shared design systems of brands like Facebook, Dropbox, Google, and Shopify and you’ll see the word content — and its dedicated creators — getting their fair share of name drops.

  
    
Facebook Design is talking about content.   
    
So is Dropbox!   
    
And Material’s got some thoughts on words too.*But a content-first viewpoint still has dramatic effects on web apps: Just look at Twitter, where a single content decision — limiting character count — has done everything to define both the glory and horror of that platform.

4. Inclusivity matters 
We designers, for all our focus on empathy, remain human beings. We aim relentlessly to take others’ views and experiences into account through user research, critique sessions, A/B testing, and myriad other methods. But at the end of the day, we’re all subject to a very human propensity: an unconscious assumption that what works for us will work for everyone else.

Just look at the language we use every day: Reach out. I see that. We hear you.

We assume these phrases are universal — equally meaningful to everyone who hears or reads them. We blithely conflate the concrete, sensory basis of these phrases with their emotional register and intent.

But it’s a faulty assumption. The blind cannot see that. The deaf do not hear you. Those with cerebral palsy may struggle to reach out.

Of course, inclusivity is about far more than accounting for disability. It’s about accounting for difference. It means that we can’t limit ourselves to “male” and “female” when we ask someone’s gender in a form. It means realizing that a “happy Father’s day!” email won’t mean the same thing to the child of a deadbeat dad as it does to one who grew up in a “normal” nuclear family. Hell, it means realizing that even the one from the “normal” family might have a bad relationship with their father — or have, not a father and a mother, but two mothers.

To enjoy and find value in a product, an individual needs to see themselves reflected within it. Without that glimpse of themselves, what a person sees instead is a refusal. The message is: you don’t belong here.

Designing for inclusivity — and ultimately, for UX — then means making space for our audience within the products we build.

I want to expand on that link between inclusive design and user experience design. Because I think that inclusivity — which is ultimately the idea that we should treat “others” not as others, but as part of us — is built right into the very notion of user experience design, and I want to take a moment to explain why.

Let’s start by looking at Peter Morville’s “user experience honeycomb”:

(The user experience honeycomb by Peter Morville)   
(The user experience honeycomb by Peter Morville)   (The user experience honeycomb by Peter Morville)   
The user experience honeycomb.The honeycomb aims to depict the interlinked characteristics that form a user experience — good or bad. The overall user experience is a gestalt — a sum total — of all these facets, arrived at via a kind of mental math we perform automatically and without deep consideration of the individual values we might assign to one or the other.

Note that each is a characteristic in the eye of the beholder. And who the beholder is, whether “us” or “other,” isn’t part of the graph. That is: the honeycomb doesn’t say who the product is credible, valuable, accessible, etc., for.

We can, of course, assume that the beholder is “our audience”: the group of people we most want to appeal to and turn into paying customers.*

Now, audiences may seem homogenous insofar as, for, say, a web design platform, all members of the audience are interested in designing websites. But that’s one, relatively minor, characteristic when we look at the whole of what makes up a human being.

Within that seemingly homogeneous crowd there’s a multitude of identities. Different races, creeds, religions, gender identities, gender expressions, socioeconomic classes, family backgrounds, cultures, and dozens of other facets of selfhood — they all want to build, manage, and grow websites.

Therefore, excluding people exhibiting any one particular flavor of any of those backgrounds poses a threat to the overall user experience. Which translates directly to a business risk — especially in the modern day, when a single tweet can mobilize massive numbers of people to either lionize or villainize a company. (Or, let’s face it: both.)

Exclusionary design, then, has a direct impact on not only the user experience, but also the bottom line.

Of course, you could argue that being inclusive poses its own business risk, in that it might alienate your more conservative users. But when you look at the size and prominence of companies that are now more than happy to take “progressive,” inclusive stances on any number of issues — from LGBTQ+ pride to toxic masculinity, it’s pretty easy to see the writing on the wall: These businesses have done the math, and they’ve come to the conclusion that the reward of inclusivity far outweighs the risk.

I would, then, posit that the definition of user experience design should be:

The practice of designing experiences to be as useful, usable, findable, credible, accessible, desirable, and valuable as possible for any user, regardless of their identity.

When we set out to design for others, we often end up designing for ourselves. (Especially when we do so without the constraints of a framework or design system.) We can, of course, make assumptions about who we’re designing for, and more specifically, who we want to design for — but our biases still lead the way.

It’s important to note that this isn’t a recrimination. We can’t avoid biased thinking because it’s been built into us from day 1 and become largely unconscious. What we can do is to work to consciously limit or overcome our biases. That’s what makes user research so fundamental. Without exploring the differing viewpoints, cognitive habits, and identities of our audiences, we end up designing to fit our expectations — and for every web professional, that’s a weakness.

Writers will tend to assume that written content is the most likely to be effective. Designers will lean heavily on the visual and/or interactive. And devs and engineers … well, my biases prevent me from easily filling in that blank.

Point is: when we stretch beyond our boundaries and defaults to incorporate others’ perspectives, we strengthen our work, making it more accessible and comprehensible to others. Which makes it that much more likely to work well for everyone.

*Because, of course, UX design is, as most commonly practiced, a capitalist discipline. Capitalism being, of course, a political philosophy.

‍5. The no-code revolution has arrived 
(Google search results page for the query “no-code”)   
(Google search results page for the query “no-code”)   (Google search results page for the query “no-code”)   
No big deal. Just over 10 billion results.When it comes to democratizing the power of software, it’s hard to think of an industry making more of an impact.

–Caleb Kaiser, Growth at AngelList

If you’re at all aware of Webflow, you know that we’re all-in on no-code, a new way of thinking about web and software development that’s ditching the traditional coding paradigm, in which code can only “properly” be produced in a text editor, written by hand, in favor of a new visual modality.

The reasons for our enthusiasm for no-code are many, but they’re ultimately driven by a desire to make coding accessible. Not simply so that “everyone can code,” of course, but so that everyone can enjoy the power to bring their ideas to life.

Instead of taking the coding bootcamp or early-childhood coding education route, we’re redesigning the very way that code is made.

In other words, we believe it’s time to refactor coding itself.

You don’t have to look far back in history to find analogous transformations. Just look back to the first graphical user interface (GUI) itself.

Before the first GUI, computing was keyboard-driven. The primary user interface (UI) was the terminal — a primitive text editor where computer users literally “told” the computer what to do through an arcane language of commands and responses. This interface model required a great deal of knowledge of its users, meaning that truly savvy computer users were few and far between. (And yes, those of you just returning from the Thanksgiving onslaught of IT support requests from computer-illiterate family members: it was worse back then.)

This also limited computers’ applicability to real-world problems. Sure, they sprang up in all sorts of high-knowledge environments, but they were anything but the ubiquitous engines of knowledge work they’ve become today.

Then came the mouse (along with almost a dozen other game-changing technologies), introduced in what’s now known as the “Mother of All Demos.”

As the demo’s Wikipedia page puts it, this demo sparked the revolution that would transform computers from mere “number-crunching” tools into “communication and information retrieval” hubs. And while it would take years for this demo to turn into a functional reality, that reality is what made computers sufficiently accessible to a sufficiently large population to make them the definitive technology of the 20th (and now 21st) century.

No-code now aims to take that sea-change a step further by empowering an even broader swath of people to not only use computers, but to build the software that makes computers so powerful, without coding it.

Today, Webflow occupies a particular niche of the no-code movement, which we call “visual web development.” Since 2013, we’ve been relentlessly focused on making the primary tools of front-end web development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — dramatically more accessible to dramatically more people. And we’re proud to say that, here in late 2019, we’ve enabled thousands upon thousands of folks who would never have thought of themselves as web developers to build beautiful, powerful websites using technologies like CSS grid, JavaScript-controlled Lottie files, and semantic HTML5.

In 2015, we began to take that mission a step further with the launch of Webflow CMS, a GraphQL-powered database and publishing tool that gives designers and developers the power to create custom schema — then design around those data fields — visually.

Here in 2019, database management and publishing tools like Webflow CMS have become the core of all kinds of powerful web-based applications, and we couldn’t be more excited to lend our voice to the continued revolution that is no-code.

Of course, we’re far from the only no-code tool out there. So we’d like to take this opportunity to shout out to our fellow travelers in the no-code future:

6. The rise of the visual developer 
Of course, technologies mean little without the human beings who use them.

And so, to parallel the wave of no-code tooling comes the rise of the no-code tool user, or, “visual developer.”

Just as the desktop publishers who used tools like Microsoft Word/Publisher, Adobe InDesign, and other tools may have known little to everything about picas and PostScript, visual developers may be anything from code experts to pure novices — but they’ve learned to master the machines of translation that turn design decisions into functional code.

(LinkedIn job postings mentioning “Webflow”)   
(LinkedIn job postings mentioning “Webflow”)   (LinkedIn job postings mentioning “Webflow”)   
At the time of writing (December 16, 2019 — a slow time in hiring), 135 jobs mention Webflow. And we’re just one visual web development tool!In doing so, they act as force multipliers to the traditionally trained coders who have built websites and apps for decades, and continue to do so. They automate tasks that used to take tedious hours of manual work. They transform static wireframes and mockups into fully functional web experiences that not only present content to visitors, but then take in visitor’s data, pipe it into email service providers and customer databases, and nurture them into leads and, ultimately, paying customers.

And most concretely, in modern web design workflows, they enable brand, growth, and marketing teams to move much, much faster. In one dramatic example, they turn the website update cycle from an 8-year process into an 8-minute one, as car-sharing startup Getaround’s Camille Esposito told us in her No Code Conf talk, “Taking back your website.”

As the no-code landscape becomes more and more mature and powerful, we expect to see “visual developer” becoming as common a sight in job postings as “web developer” and “web designer” are now — and in the latter case, we can honestly see “visual developer” taking their place entirely.

7. Design has its seat at the table. Now what? 
Ever heard the phrase “careful what you wish for”?

Design has been pushing for a so-called “seat at the table” — that is, a voice in higher-level decision-making at companies — for years now. And increasingly, we’re seeing that happen. At least, according to the zeitgeist. Every day, more and more articles suggest that design is the key differentiator at [insert hot startup name here]. Design-focused content seems to be gaining more and more prominence in popular culture, with documentary series like Abstract popping up in watercooler conversations almost as often as [insert whatever the kids are watching these days here]. Every time I grab a seat in a cafe, the word “UX” resounds around the room at least half a dozen times every hour — granted, I live in the heart of UX country, but still.

And yet, how much traction has design really gained in the top echelons of businesses? The question wells up in me every time I see another Facebook scandal grabbing headlines, or hear the latest on the Domino’s accessibility lawsuit. I wonder about it every time the question or Uber or Airbnb’s impact on communities pops back up in the Twittersphere.

The thing is: it’s a false question. Design has always and already been at every table in “The Business.”

They just don’t call themselves designers. Or, in some cases, value the things we’ve come to expect designers to value. They aren’t necessarily fighting for users, or even trying to balance user goals and experience with business value. In many cases, the business value — i.e., shareholder gains — is what’s truly paramount in their minds.

Now, this isn’t meant as an excoriation of these folks. Without wading into the morass of ethics, I get why they’re focused on shareholder value, and why evocations of “freedom of speech” tend to crop up in their arguments (misplaced as they are).

It’s merely intended as a corrective. “Design” as such doesn’t need a previously unassigned seat at the table. What we’re often arguing for is instead a different view of design. A principled and conscious approach to the design of systems (i.e., businesses) that takes into account the myriad other systems each business impacts, from the political landscape to the local housing market.

So, to return to Amy’s point above: the thing to focus on while you’re fighting for your seat at the table is the development of your strategy for making use of that seat. And to my mind, a key starting point for the development of that strategy is the acknowledgement that design is very much happening at that seat. It’s up to you to, in the words of Mad Men’s Don Draper, change the conversation about design that’s already happening there.

Because, like it or not, everyone truly is a designer. (Yep!) But more on that in the next section.

Or course, as Maxim Leyzerovich notes here:

Design’s gaining of a seat at the table isn’t purely a one-sided affair. Both brands that want to give design a seat at the table and the designers who want to give it one need to be thinking about how design will thrive within an organization if it wants to attract and keep talent.

And, in confirmation of design’s potential to positively influence “from the table,” each of these things aren’t design-specific — they’re necessities for any modern org, which will shape perception of a brand for any professional, but also for the broader public.

So, if you’ve been fighting for a seat at the table, it’s past time to be asking yourself: What are you going to do with that seat?

Speaking with the voice of experience here: org design is an incredible — and fun — challenge. Working in the media of identities and careers is far more dynamic than pixels.

8. Role is not identity 
Is everyone a designer? Yes, just as everyone is a writer.

(Trust me: I’m a professional writer. And the more I try to deny others that role, the higher my stress levels and the harder my work gets. The more I include other writers’ perspectives, regardless of their individual skill levels, the better my work tends to get. Though it sure does make line edits more complicated.)

The difference between you, titled designer, and any other person who designs without the title, is not one of kind, but of degree. Writing and design are skills, not identities, so “being” a writer or designer is more like occupying a spot on a spectrum. (A lot like gender, ya know?).

The difference is in skill level, primarily, but also in education and context. Just because we all design doesn’t mean we’re all good at it.

The important thing to realize, however, is that your role is not your identity. Not who you are. The claim that a writer, lawyer, or product manager designs shouldn’t feel like a threat to your identity not only because it’s simply a skill, but because it’s not your identity.

The problem with overidentifying with a skill — with considering it a part of your identity — is that your identity can then be threatened by all sorts of small attacks. Whenever your work is criticized, you become the subject of that criticism. Whenever a “non-designer” (or non-whatever) applies their skill better than you did, you were outdone not in skill, but in identity. Makes you wonder if this sort of overidentification has a part to play in our industry’s ongoing struggle with impostor syndrome …

But actor Sam Neill says all this much better than I. So, over to you, Sam:

9. Okay, one visual trend: marquee is back, baby!‍ 
  
    
And I know we’re all excited by excited by excited by that.

A vision for web design we can all (hopefully) get behind 
When I read back over this post, I for one can’t help but feel a stirring of hope. Because these 9 trends all suggest a future for website design that I can’t help but love.

A web design devoted to helping people understand what’s true and what isn’t. A web design for all, regardless of ability, or identity. A web design that’s inclusive of creators who do things a little differently — that is, code visually.

None of this is going to be easy. There will be pushback. There will be those who don’t want to sacrifice numbers for the sake of making principled stands.

<ami:content>La ministre du Travail Élisabeth Borne a annoncé mardi le maintien au mois de mars des conditions actuelles d&apos;indemnisation du chômage partiel, dont le reste à charge pour les entreprises devait augmenter le mois prochain.

Maintenu à 15% 
«On va prolonger au mois de mars les taux actuels d&apos;activité partielle donc il n&apos;y aura aucun reste à charge pour les secteurs qui sont frappés par la crise et on maintiendra le taux de 15% pour les autres, pour répondre à l&apos;incertitude sur la situation sanitaire», a déclaré la ministre sur BFM Business. 

Actuellement, la règle générale est que le salarié est indemnisé à hauteur de 70% de son salaire brut (84% net) avec un reste en charge de 15% pour les entreprises. Celui-ci devait passer à 40% en mars (avec une indemnisation du salarié baissant à 60%), une date qui avait déjà été reportée plusieurs fois du fait de la prolongation de la crise sanitaire liée au Covid-19.

Secteurs les plus touchés 
Les secteurs les plus touchés par la crise (tourisme, culture, sport et loisirs, hôtellerie-restauration, transport... et les activités en dépendant) continueront eux à bénéficier d&apos;une prise en charge à 100%. «Le chômage partiel a protégé neuf millions de salariés au printemps et trois millions au mois de novembre», a ajouté Élisabeth Borne.

La ministre a invité les entreprises des secteurs moins touchés par la crise qui anticipent une baisse d&apos;activité plus durable à «signer des accords d&apos;activité partielle longue durée (APLD)». Ce dispositif autorise une réduction du temps de travail jusqu&apos;à 40% d&apos;heures chômées en moyenne pendant six à 24 mois, sous condition d&apos;un accord d&apos;entreprise ou de branche, validé par l&apos;administration et comprenant des engagements sur l&apos;emploi et la formation. Actuellement, plus de 7 000 entreprises et 530 000 salariés sont couverts par un accord APLD, a-t-elle précisé. Le chômage partiel classique a déjà coûté près de 30 milliards d’euros à l’État.

Nouvelles mesures, nouveaux bilans et faits marquants: un point sur les dernières évolutions de la pandémie de Covid-19 dans le monde. 
- Le Japon vaccine - 
Le Japon a commencé mercredi la première étape de sa campagne de vaccination contre le coronavirus, visant d&apos;abord à protéger 40.000 employés de son secteur médical, à cinq mois de l&apos;ouverture programmée des Jeux olympiques de Tokyo, reportés l&apos;an dernier. 

Les premières injections du vaccin de Pfizer/BioNTech, le premier à avoir été autorisé au Japon dimanche dernier, ont eu lieu mercredi matin dans un hôpital de la capitale. 

- Pays-Bas: couvre-feu confirmé -  
Une cour d&apos;appel néerlandaise a suspendu mardi un jugement rendu plus tôt dans la journée par un tribunal de La Haye qui avait ordonné au gouvernement de lever le couvre-feu national contre le Covid-19, ont rapporté des médias locaux.

&quot;Cela signifie que le couvre-feu de 21H00 (20H00 GMT) reste en vigueur&quot;, a précisé la télévision publique NOS. 

- L&apos;OMC veut apporter sa pierre - 
&quot;Je pense que l&apos;OMC peut contribuer davantage à la résolution de la pandémie de Covid-19 en aidant à améliorer l&apos;accès des pays pauvres aux vaccins&quot;, a déclaré sa future patronne Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. 

&quot;Il est vraiment dans l&apos;intérêt de chaque pays de voir tout le monde se faire vacciner&quot;, a-t-elle ajouté. 

- Australie: confinement levé à Melbourne -

La pandémie du nouveau coronavirus a fait au moins 2.408.243 morts dans le monde depuis fin décembre 2019, selon un bilan établi par l&apos;AFP à partir de sources officielles mardi. 

Après les Etats-Unis (487.714 morts), les pays comptant le plus de décès sont le Brésil (240.940), le Mexique (175.986), l&apos;Inde (155.813) et le Royaume-Uni (117.396). 

Le Mexique a franchi mardi la barre des deux millions de cas de Covid-19 depuis le début de la pandémie. 

Le nombre des victimes est globalement sous-évalué. Il se fonde sur les bilans quotidiens des autorités nationales de santé mais exclut les révisions réalisées à posteriori par des organismes statistiques.

<ami:content>&quot;Nous nous félicitons des décisions des régulateurs qui affirment le bénéfice de notre vaccin pour arrêter la pandémie&quot;, a déclaré dans un communiqué Ann Taylor, médecin chef d&apos;AstraZenaca, soulignant sa confiance que les vaccinations puissent reprendre en Europe.  

Une quinzaine de pays, dont l&apos;Allemagne, la France et l&apos;Italie, avaient suspendu par précaution l&apos;utilisation de ce vaccin après le signalement d&apos;effets secondaires tels que des troubles de la coagulation et la formation de caillots.  

Reconfinée aux trois quarts depuis lundi, l&apos;Italie reprendra dès vendredi les vaccinations avec l&apos;AstraZeneca, tout comme la France, l&apos;Allemagne, la Bulgarie ou encore la Slovénie. D&apos;autres pays s&apos;y remettront la semaine prochaine, tels l&apos;Espagne, le Portugal ou les Pays-Bas.  

La Norvège et la Suède, par contre, vont attendre d&apos;avoir effectué la semaine prochaine leurs propres évaluations, car une équipe médicale norvégienne dit voir un lien entre le produit et des caillots sanguins observés chez des patients tombés dans un état grave, voire décédés, quelques jours après une première injection.  

L&apos;Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) a renouvelé jeudi son appel à continuer à utiliser ce vaccin. Son Comité consultatif mondial de la sécurité vaccinale (GACVS) doit publier vendredi un avis à son propos.  

Peu avant l&apos;EMA, le régulateur sanitaire britannique, le MHRA, qui examinait les vaccins AstraZeneca et Pfizer/BioNTech, avait également conclu &quot;qu&apos;il n&apos;y a aucune preuve que les caillots sanguins dans les veines se produisent plus que ce à quoi on pourrait s&apos;attendre en l&apos;absence de vaccination, pour l&apos;un comme l&apos;autre vaccin&quot;.  

Le Royaume-Uni a annoncé une réduction de ses approvisionnements en vaccins en avril, susceptible de ralentir sa campagne de vaccination, l&apos;une des plus avancées au monde.  

Selon les médias britanniques, le problème d&apos;approvisionnement est dû à un retard de livraison de cinq millions de doses produites en Inde par le Serum Institute pour AstraZeneca.  

La Commission européenne a de son côté annoncé qu&apos;elle allait activer une procédure contractuelle pour résoudre le conflit avec AstraZeneca, dont les livraisons sont nettement inférieures aux chiffres prévus.  

- &quot;Taper très dur&quot; -  

Malgré ces déconvenues, la vaccination a continué d&apos;accélérer. Au moins 402,3 millions de doses ont été administrées dans le monde, dont plus d&apos;un quart aux Etats-Unis, selon un comptage de l&apos;AFP arrêté jeudi à 16H30 GMT.  

La situation épidémique reste néanmoins &quot;particulièrement&quot; inquiétante dans les Balkans et en Europe centrale, selon l&apos;OMS, à l&apos;heure où le nombre de cas en Europe augmente pour la troisième semaine consécutive.  

&quot;Le nombre de personnes qui meurent du Covid-19 en Europe est plus élevé aujourd&apos;hui qu&apos;il ne l&apos;était à la même époque l&apos;année dernière&quot;, a souligné le directeur Europe de l&apos;OMS, Hans Kluge.  

La pandémie a fait au moins 2,68 millions de morts dans le monde, selon un bilan établi jeudi par l&apos;AFP, et nombre de pays sont engagés dans une course contre la montre avec le virus.  

C&apos;est le cas de la France, où s&apos;approche la barre des 100.000 morts: le gouvernement, évoquant une &quot;troisième vague&quot;, a annoncé dans la soirée un troisième confinement en un an, plus souple que les précédents.  

Plus de 20 millions de Français, dont les habitants de la région parisienne, vont de nouveau être confinés à partir de vendredi et pour un mois. Les écoles et commerces essentiels (dont les librairies) resteront ouverts.  

L&apos;épidémie accélère nettement dans le pays, où plus de 38.000 contaminations ont été enregistrées en 24 heures. &quot;La situation est clairement critique. Ça va taper très dur jusqu&apos;à la mi-avril&quot;, avait souligné mercredi soir le président Emmanuel Macron.  

- Hommage en Italie -  

L&apos;Italie commémorait quant à elle jeudi les plus de 103.000 morts de l&apos;épidémie de Covid-19, avec drapeaux en berne sur les bâtiments publics.  

Le Premier ministre est venu se recueillir à Bergame (nord), ville du nord du pays restée associée aux images de camions militaires transportant des cercueils en pleine nuit il y a un an.  

En Allemagne, également touchée par une troisième vague, le gouvernement a appelé la population à être &quot;responsable&quot; et à ne pas se rendre dans la très prisée île espagnole de Majorque, malgré l&apos;affrètement de centaines de vols touristiques.  

Plusieurs responsables régionaux allemands ont exhorté jeudi les autorités européennes à accélérer l&apos;examen du vaccin russe Spoutnik V et à anticiper son déploiement dans l&apos;UE.  

La Bulgarie, qui se targuait jusqu&apos;à présent de mesures souples face à la pandémie, a annoncé jeudi un durcissement de ses restrictions, alors que le nombre de contaminations y augmente fortement. Ecoles, universités, restaurants, théâtres, cinémas, centres commerciaux, casinos et salles de sport y fermeront à partir de lundi pour dix jours.  

En Ukraine, le maire de Kiev, Vitali Klitchko, a annoncé le renforcement des restrictions dans la capitale à partir de samedi pour trois semaines.  

Au Chili, un reconfinement strict du tiers du pays entre en vigueur jeudi, malgré la progression rapide de la campagne de vaccination dans ce pays.

<ami:content>&quot;Grâce à toutes les personnes qui ont combattu sans relâche pour que le droit à mourir dignement soit reconnu en Espagne&quot;, cette loi &quot;devient enfin une réalité&quot;, a-t-il ajouté.  

L&apos;Espagne devient ainsi le quatrième pays européen à dépénaliser l&apos;euthanasie, après les Pays-Bas, la Belgique et le Luxembourg.   

Le parlement portugais a également voté fin janvier une loi légalisant l&apos;euthanasie, mais la Cour constitutionnelle a retoqué lundi le texte, qui va être renvoyé aux députés.  

La loi espagnole autorise aussi bien l&apos;euthanasie - c&apos;est à dire lorsque le soignant provoque la mort du patient - que le suicide médicalement assisté - lorsque le patient prend lui-même la dose de produit prescrite pour se donner la mort.  

- Strictes conditions -  

Elle prévoit que toute personne ayant &quot;une maladie grave et incurable&quot; ou des douleurs &quot;chroniques le plaçant dans une situation d&apos;incapacité&quot; puisse demander l&apos;aide du corps médical pour mourir et s&apos;éviter ainsi &quot;une souffrance intolérable&quot;.  

Des conditions strictes encadrent toutefois la démarche: la personne, espagnole ou résidant dans le pays, doit ainsi être &quot;capable et consciente&quot; lorsqu&apos;elle fait la demande, qui doit être formulée par écrit &quot;sans pression extérieure&quot; et renouvelée quinze jours plus tard.  

Le médecin pourra toujours rejeter cette demande s&apos;il estime que ces critères ne sont pas remplis ou faire valoir &quot;son objection de conscience&quot;. En outre, elle devra être approuvée par un autre médecin et recevoir le feu vert d&apos;une commission d&apos;évaluation.  

L&apos;adoption de cette loi intervient après plusieurs cas emblématiques dans le pays au cours des dernières décennies, dont celui de Ramón Sampedro, un homme tétraplégique incarné à l&apos;écran par Javier Bardem dans le film oscarisé &quot;Mar adentro&quot;.  

C&apos;est une victoire &quot;pour les gens qui pourront en bénéficier&quot;, et aussi &quot;pour Ramón&quot;, s&apos;est félicité auprès de l&apos;AFP Ramona Maneiro, l&apos;amie de M. Sampedro qui l&apos;a aidé à mourir en 1998.   

- &quot;Homicide&quot; -  

Vent debout contre cette réforme, l&apos;Eglise catholique espagnole a comparé l&apos;euthanasie à &quot;une forme d&apos;homicide&quot; tandis que le parti d&apos;extrême droite Vox a annoncé qu&apos;il déposerait un recours devant le Tribunal constitutionnel.  

Déguisés en faucheuses noires pour certains et déployant une banderole contre le &quot;gouvernement de la mort&quot;, au son de tambours funèbres, une centaine d&apos;opposants à la loi ont manifesté jeudi devant les portes de la Chambre des députés.  

Cette loi &quot;viole le droit à la vie, sans lequel aucun autre n&apos;existe&quot;, a dénoncé l&apos;un de ces militants, Alexander Cuevas, 21 ans.  

Polonia Castellanos, porte-parole de l&apos;Association espagnole des avocats chrétiens, a, elle, déploré un &quot;jour triste (...) ne laissant aucune liberté à ceux qui souffrent et que l&apos;on pousse à choisir la solution la plus rapide: la mort&quot;.  

Une dizaine de militants pro-euthanasie se sont réunis au même endroit peu de temps avant, comme Asun Gomez Bueno, dont le mari atteint de sclérose en plaque est mort à 50 ans après des années de souffrance.   

Saluant un &quot;jour très heureux&quot;, elle a regretté qu&apos;on l&apos;ait &quot;traitée d&apos;assassine&quot; car elle avait voulu &quot;aider (son) mari à arrêter de souffrir&quot;.  

Depuis que l&apos;euthanasie a surgi dans le débat public, plusieurs cas retentissants ont défrayé la chronique en Espagne. L&apos;un des plus récents est celui d&apos;Ángel Hernández, arrêté en 2019 pour avoir aidé sa femme atteinte de sclérose en plaques à mourir, et qui attend d&apos;être jugé.

<ami:content>At Vimeo, I am the sole UX writer/content strategist for all of our products, across all platforms. Whether we’re testing new player outros, optimizing Vimeo On Demand title pages, or launching a new suite of creator tools geared toward businesses, I am the human behind all the words embedded in the UI. Because I write for so many different products and platforms, I’m always hopping across a bunch of different teams at once — and each team has its own special way of getting things done.

This array of working styles, tools, and processes quickly becomes a nightmare for a type-A organization freak like myself — especially when it comes to keeping track of the copy I’ve written, and making sure it’s consistent.

Fast &amp; furious 
Our creator tools team likes to work quick and dirty, in two-week sprints. Often, I’m brought in at the beginning of the sprint to learn about what we’re trying to launch and why. I’m involved in early feature conception and user testing, and I work alongside the designer to review mocks and provide copy that works within them. In theory, we have a final design review together so that I can QA all copy and make sure we haven’t missed any error states, etc. In reality? I’m often stalking Zeplin projects to make sure I’ve seen the most up-to-date designs before dev gets too far along with their build. But when I find something that needs to be changed, what to do? Do I comment in Zeplin and tag the designer? Or do I ticket the issue in GitHub and assign it to the lead dev to update in the build only? Or do I pass it to the QA specialist first?

Along with being unsure about the best way to get copy updated before a feature goes into production, I also wonder if I should even bother being diligent in updating my original copy deck. When the developers are referencing the designs for copy anyhow, does it matter? The answer is pretty much always yes. And in fact, our developers really like having one place where they can find *all* of the copy related to a given project, including error states and upsell messages that may not be laid out in the comps.

One source of truthThe need for “one copy repository to rule them all” comes up a lot, especially when I’m working on mobile projects. I try to reuse copy across platforms to ensure brand consistency throughout our many mobile and TV apps. When a designer comes to me asking about Apple TV empty states, I like to be able to reference the versions I wrote for iOS a few months back. For a long time, that process consisted of me digging back through my archive of original copy decks.

  
    
If something changed between when I initially wrote the deck — let’s say we made a last-minute update before pushing something out to mods (staff members with special permissions) — and I didn’t record that update, I’d be repurposing incorrect copy. And given that I’m spread so thin across projects, I may not realize this right away. Not cool.

I wanted one place, one doc, to house all of the strings I was writing for iOS, Android, Apple TV, Roku, etc.

A janky string CMSI wanted to be able to “tag” each string with the platform I wrote it for so I’d know what’s what without having to reproduce obscure error states within the app at a later date. I also wanted to sort strings by the section of the app in which they appear, and the action or feature they relate to. And I didn’t want to have to wade through code in Github to do so. Most importantly of all, perhaps, is that I wanted to empower our engineers to hop into this doc and find pre-approved copy to get a head start on their build. (Of course, I still want to QA any copy they’re implementing to make sure they’re using the right line in the right place, and that they’re adhering to our style guidelines.) OK, but actually most importantly is that I wanted to create a system that would scale as we add more writers to our team (a girl can dream).

  
    
I’m still waiting for the perfect solution, but for now, I’ve got a very budget CMS of sorts: I created a Google Spreadsheet with different tabs/sheets for different types of strings. For instance, I have tabs for:

- README
- Alerts/Confirmations
- Context
- Empty States
- Error Messages
- Labels/Menus
- Logged-Out States
- Player
- Screens
- Success Messages

This way, if a mobile designer asks me to help write copy for a setting of upload error messages, which I know I’ve touched before, I can go into the “Error Messages” tab, and sort the “Section” column from Z-A to pull all of the “Upload” strings up to the top. Then, I can quickly scan the “Description” column to find the error messages. Or, I can just ctr+F to find any error messages that reference “upload.” As I mentioned, this a fairly janky approach, but I’ve yet to find a better way to record and search for the strings I’ve written.

A plea for helpAll this said, I know there must be a better way that I’m not aware of yet. I’m writing this post in hopes that someone who is more crafty than I will propose a more efficient and flexible solution for managing heaps of product copy — ideally one that already exists. If you are that magical person, please shoot me a comment!

<ami:content>C&apos;est la signature de cette charte le 15 mars par les opérateurs (Bouygues Telecom, Free Mobile, Orange et SFR) qui a rendu possible le lancement commercial de la 5G à Paris, alors que les villes franciliennes de la petite couronne bénéficient de la couverture de la dernière génération de réseau mobile depuis fin 2020.  

En contrepartie, les opérateurs se sont notamment engagés à &quot;optimiser le recyclage des équipements de téléphonie&quot; ou à favoriser &quot;l&apos;inclusion numérique&quot;.  

La maire socialiste Anne Hidalgo a fait voter cette charte malgré l&apos;opposition de ses partenaires écologistes, qui réclamaient un moratoire en attendant le résultat d&apos;études sur l&apos;impact environnemental de la 5G.  

&quot;Il y a déjà des rapports qui existent, d&apos;autres vont arriver&quot;, a réagi auprès de l&apos;AFP l&apos;adjoint au budget à la mairie de Paris Paul Simondon (PS), qui a piloté la rédaction de la charte. Pour l&apos;élu parisien, &quot;les agences en question dont c&apos;est la responsabilité (Arcep, Anses, ANFR, Ademe) ont besoin que le déploiement soit en cours pour faire des mesures, évaluer leurs techniques et boucler ces rapports.&quot;  

Orange et SFR, les premiers à avoir officialisé le lancement de leurs réseaux respectifs, ont annoncé vouloir déployer exclusivement sur la bande de fréquences 3,5 GHz, celle &quot;qui offre les meilleurs débits&quot;.  

&quot;En proposant la 5G dès ce vendredi aux Parisiennes et Parisiens, SFR a montré d&apos;une part sa volonté de respecter le temps du débat citoyen, et d&apos;autre part sa capacité à déployer son réseau 5G, dans le respect de la charte adoptée par le Conseil de Paris&quot;, a indiqué Grégory Rabuel, directeur général de SFR, dans un communiqué.  

Chez Bouygues Telecom, qui lancera également son réseau 5G vendredi, le PDG Richard Viel a estimé que &quot;la 5G constitue un véritable avantage compétitif pour Paris, qui s&apos;apprête à accueillir les JO de 2024&quot;.  

- Lille en attente -  

De Paris à Nantes, en passant par Rennes, plusieurs maires écologistes ou de gauche de grandes villes avaient décidé de lancer fin 2020 un &quot;débat public&quot; pour notamment répondre à un &quot;besoin de transparence&quot; au sujet des éventuelles conséquences du déploiement de la 5G sur l&apos;environnement et la santé.  

D&apos;autres communes comme Lille ont annoncé être en faveur d&apos;un moratoire jusqu&apos;à la publication prévue au printemps 2021 d&apos;un rapport de l&apos;Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire (Anses).  

Les opérateurs et les pouvoirs publics ont cherché toutefois à trouver un compromis politique pour désamorcer un sujet devenu encore plus polémique depuis que la Convention citoyenne pour le climat a elle-même recommandé un moratoire cet été.  

Plusieurs villes, au départ récalcitrantes, ont fini par laisser les opérateurs activer leurs réseaux 5G, à l&apos;image de Strasbourg, Lyon et Bordeaux.  

Bordeaux, dirigée par l&apos;écologiste Pierre Hurmic, s&apos;est même dite &quot;désolée&quot; de l&apos;ouverture de la 5G locale début février.  

&quot;Clairement, on ne peut pas faire ce qu&apos;on veut sur notre propre territoire. Nous ne sommes pas écoutés. L&apos;État, malgré ses grands discours sur le changement climatique, n&apos;entend pas&quot;, avait déploré l&apos;adjointe au maire Delphine Jamet auprès de l&apos;AFP.  

Si la 5G promet d&apos;offrir, à terme, un débit jusqu&apos;à dix fois plus rapide, les opérateurs comptent surtout sur elle pour l&apos;instant pour éviter la saturation de leurs réseaux mobiles.  

Selon des chiffres publiés jeudi soir par l&apos;Arcep, le régulateur des télécoms, il y avait 11.119 sites 5G opérationnels en France au 28 février dernier, soit une hausse de 11,6% par rapport à fin janvier.

<ami:content>Une opération policière avait été lancée à 06H30 (05H30 GMT) pour l&apos;extraire de l&apos;université de Lérida, en Catalogne (nord-est de l&apos;Espagne), où il était barricadé depuis lundi avec des dizaines de sympathisants qui voulaient empêcher son arrestation.  

Pablo Hasél -- de son vrai nom Pablo Rivadulla Duró -- avait jusqu&apos;à vendredi soir pour se rendre volontairement en prison et commencer à y purger la peine de neuf mois qui lui avait été infligée par la justice espagnole.  

Reconnu coupable d&apos;apologie du terrorisme, ainsi que d&apos;injures et calomnies à l&apos;encontre de la couronne et de l&apos;Etat, il avait été condamné pour des tweets dans lesquels il qualifiait notamment les forces de l&apos;ordre espagnoles de &quot;mercenaires de merde&quot;, les accusait de torture et d&apos;assassinats et s&apos;en prenait également à la monarchie.  

&quot;Ils devront venir m&apos;enlever et cela servira aussi à dépeindre l&apos;État sous son vrai visage, celui d&apos;une fausse démocratie&quot;, avait déclaré à l&apos;AFP ce rappeur catalan de 32 ans vendredi par téléphone.  

- &quot;Epée de Damoclès&quot; -  

Plusieurs manifestations parfois tendues en soutien à Pablo Hasél avaient eu lieu ces dernières semaines à Madrid et Barcelone, tandis que plus de 200 personnalités du monde culturel hispanophone, dont le réalisateur Pedro Almodóvar et l&apos;acteur Javier Bardem, avaient signé une tribune en sa faveur.  

Les signataires y affirmaient notamment que la condamnation de Pablo Hasél constituait une &quot;épée de Damoclès&quot; au-dessus de tous les artistes et accusaient l&apos;Espagne d&apos;agir comme &quot;la Turquie ou le Maroc&quot;.   

L&apos;affaire était devenue une véritable épine dans le pied du gouvernement de gauche de Pedro Sanchez, à plus forte raison à l&apos;approche des élections catalanes de dimanche dernier.  

La porte-parole de l&apos;exécutif, María Jesús Montero, avait ainsi reconnu la semaine dernière &quot;un manque de proportionnalité&quot; dans la peine infligée au rappeur.   

Sur la défensive, le gouvernement avait également promis &quot;une réforme&quot; pour que les &quot;excès verbaux commis dans le cadre de manifestations artistiques, culturelles ou intellectuelles&quot; ne relèvent plus du droit pénal et ne se traduisent plus par des peines de prison.  

Partenaire des socialistes au sein du gouvernement, le parti de gauche radicale Podemos a vertement dénoncé mardi l&apos;arrestation du rappeur.  

&quot;Tous ceux qui se considèrent progressistes et se vantent de la +pleine normalité démocratique+ (de l&apos;Espagne), devraient avoir honte. Vont-ils fermer les yeux ? Il n&apos;y a pas de progrès si nous ne voulons pas reconnaître les manques démocratiques actuels&quot;, a twitté Podemos.  

Il s&apos;agissait d&apos;une allusion à des commentaires récents très controversés de son chef, Pablo Iglesias, qui avait déclaré la semaine dernière qu&apos;il n&apos;y avait pas &quot;une situation de pleine normalité politique et démocratique en Espagne&quot;.  

Ces propos avaient déclenché un tollé de la part de la part de tous les partis de l&apos;opposition de droite, mais aussi un énorme malaise au sein même du Parti socialiste de Pedro Sánchez.  

Le cas de Pablo Hasél rappelle celui d&apos;un autre rappeur espagnol, Valtonyc. Ce dernier s&apos;était exilé en Belgique en mai 2018 après confirmation de sa condamnation en Espagne à trois ans et demi de prison pour &quot;apologie du terrorisme&quot; et du groupe séparatiste basque ETA, &quot;injures à la Couronne&quot; et &quot;menaces&quot; dans ses chansons.  

Il est visé depuis par un mandat d&apos;arrêt européen émis par la justice espagnole. En septembre 2018, un tribunal de Gand avait rejeté l&apos;exécution du mandat. La procédure est toujours en cours devant une cour d&apos;appel.

The misconception that UI/UX design is an art form harms designers. Photo by Joanna Kosinska on Unsplash . 
I used to date a professional painter. Like “pay rent and keep the lights on with commissions” professional painter. Not just an artist, but an Arteest. Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Codey’s dated someone before? Doubtful.” And trust me, I’m every bit as surprised by my dating luck as you are. But we’re getting sidetracked.

I’d see Emma (name changed for privacy reasons) spend months on a single commission. She’d take a few weeks to brainstorm and search for inspiration. After Emma finally decided what to paint, she’d spend hours prepping the canvas. She’d lose sleep with countless late nights as she pored over every detail. I once watched her spend a whole day perfecting the pigmentation on a single shadow.

On one occasion, after putting all that time and effort into a commission, a client said “Hmm. I’m not sure I like it. Can you do something else?” Rightfully crestfallen, Emma recommenced the entire process.

When I first started designing UI and UX, I often found myself in similar situations: spending countless hours on a project only to hear that my design “just doesn’t look right.” It wasn’t until I saw one of Emma’s clients say those same words that I realized my problem: I treated my designs as though they were art commissions.

Treating UI/UX design as though it’s art is bad practice. 
When we treat UI/UX design as though it’s art, we do ourselves a disservice for a few reasons. First, treating design like art propagates the fallacious notion that good design is subjective. As I’ll discuss later, good design is objective; it possesses measurable criteria that we can use to assess its value.

Next, treating design as though it’s art spreads the false notion that design is an innate skill that can’t be taught. You don’t need Picasso-level intrinsic artistic talent to master digital product design. Good design can absolutely be taught and teaching good design comprises a large part of my goal for this article.

Finally, treating design as though it’s art severely limits what you can do with your designs. As I’ll discuss later, good design empathizes with its user and creatively solves its users’ problems. When we treat design as art, we tend to prioritize aesthetics and visuals over usability and problem solving, which will deliver a severely limited product 11 times out of 10.

Good UI/UX design is science. 
Ultimately, good digital product design is a science. It solves problems, begins with empathy, adheres to the scientific method, is objective, and can be taught. With this article, I intend to prove that good design is a science that can be mastered, and provide actionable steps along the way for achieving good design.

Alright, this intro has already dragged on for wayyy too long. So without further ado, here are 5 reasons why good UI/UX design is science, not art.

1. Good Design solves problems. Art doesn’t (at least not inherently). 
Just like science, UI/UX design seeks to identify — and ultimately solve — problems. The very first step of the scientific method is to identify a problem (more on this later). Your designs should not exist solely for their aesthetic value. They should get sh*t done. Art, on the other hand, does not inherently solve problems. I know that sometimes art advocates for certain causes, probes us to think deeply about societal injustice, and asks us to question internal biases. Good art can identify problems. But it doesn’t usually offer its audience actionable steps to solve the problems it identifies. For both science and design, on the other hand, solving problems is the whole point.

(A woman views sculptures in an art gallery.)   
(A woman views sculptures in an art gallery.)   (A woman views sculptures in an art gallery.)   
Art is necessary and important, but does not necessarily exist for the sole purpose of solving its consumers’ problems. Photo by Azka Firas on Unsplash .Danielle Miller, a designer for the award-winning team over at Clockwork  writes, “Smart user experience design starts by identifying a problem and guiding all ideas to solve that problem.” This “problem” could refer to a variety of different needs a user might have. A well-designed e-commerce site, for example, might solve a user’s problem by helping the customer make an informed purchase, with confidence that they’ve ordered the right product. A well designed ride-share app can solve a user’s problem by getting them home safely after a night out with friends.

Successful products solve problems. That problem might be getting a user from unregistered to registered for an event. It might mean communicating a brand’s vision so customers can understand it. Whether we’re talking about an app, a website, or more nuanced digital experience, UX design stands guard against offering features for the sake of offering features. — Danielle Miller, Clockwork 

Still not on board? Let’s take a look at some examples. We’ll start with an extreme example of a website that looks beautiful, but is ultimately useless because it doesn’t solve any problems.

(A screenshot of corndog.io.)   
(A screenshot of corndog.io.)   (A screenshot of corndog.io.)   
Corndog.io is a beautiful website but a bad UI/UX design because it doesn’t solve any problems.Look at corndog.io . Now that is a beautiful website. Very few things in life compare to the beauty of a fresh, crispy corndog. But does it make the cut for good digital product design? It absolutely does not. Because it doesn’t solve any problems; it’s just corn dogs floating across your screen. Let’s shift our focus to a more realistic example.

Before I dissect the following piece of UI, I should note that Outcrowd, the agency responsible for creating it, is utterly fantastic. On the whole, they’re incredibly talented and I can only dream of publishing work even remotely close to the quality products that they churn out on a daily basis. But here’s an example of when they let their artwork overshadow their UX.

(A UI design whose art overshadows its UX.)   
(A UI design whose art overshadows its UX.)   (A UI design whose art overshadows its UX.)   
This landing page is art, and it’s beautiful, but it’s not good design.Here’s a landing page for Paulini, a fictional travel library for tourists. This design is beautiful. The illustration is tasteful. I can’t overstate how good this looks. But whether a design looks good bears little weight on whether the design is usable. When I look at this landing page, it’s not immediately clear what problems this site solves for a user. I can spot a few links resting cozily in the top nav. I notice a call-to-action. I see some very vague directions in the bottom left corner of the page. But it’s anyone’s guess as to where each nav-link leads, or what I’d be “discovering more” of if I click on the call-to-action. This landing page is art. It’s beautiful. But it doesn’t solve any problems.

So let’s take a look at a design that does solve problems. Now that we’ve considered a couple nonexamples, we should consider a UI that gets it right. And we’ll give Outcrowd a shot at redemption while we’re at it.

(A UI design that is both artful and has great UX.)   
(A UI design that is both artful and has great UX.)   (A UI design that is both artful and has great UX.)   
This landing page is both beautiful and functional.Above you can see a landing page designed by the same agency, for a similar product: Wedly constitutes another fictional travel agency. This design is equally beautiful. The illustration is equally tasteful. The difference lies in this landing page’s usability. This design not only solves problems, but it communicates clearly which problems it solves. The problem? A traveler wants an unforgettable experience — a step above the average tourist trip. This is a website solves that problem by helping travelers plan that experience. It’s clear where each nav link leads. It’s clear what happens when I click the call-to-action. This is top-notch design.

I promised in the introduction that I wouldn’t just point out examples of good and bad design. I told you I’d also offer actionable steps for achieving good design. So how does a designer make sure they’re crafting UI and UX that solves problems? Danielle Miller, whom I mentioned earlier, offers three ways we can master this technique.

First, we need to conduct research. Before we even begin sketching out our ideas for a product or service, we need to “understand how that product or service fits into the user’s life.” If you encounter difficulties during your user research, Fabricio Teixeira wrote an excellent article about what kinds of questions to ask — and how to ask them — during user research.

Second, Miller says that we should constantly be asking “why.” Every button, every paragraph, every element, ask “Why is this important? Why am I adding this?”

Finally, any time you design an element within a UI, ask yourself “what problem does this solve?” If you don’t have an answer, that element is probably superfluous.

2. Good UI/UX design begins with empathy. Art doesn’t necessarily (although it really should). 
If both science and design solve problems, then empathy is a prerequisite to both industries. How can you effectively solve a problem for someone if you don’t know that person’s priorities, cognitive and physical restrictions, and other needs? When science fails to begin with empathy, it creates the wrong solution to the wrong problem for the wrong stakeholders. The same is true for UI/UX design.

Let me offer the way my home city of Boston handled the pandemic as an example. When COVID-19 struck Boston, many of our city’s officials and social scientists realized that we have a rather large population of essential workers. I’m talking medical professionals, public transit workers, grocery store staff. We had a huge number of people who simply couldn’t work from home due to the nature of their job, and many of those folks simply cannot afford frequent testing at private healthcare providers. These essential workers also come into contact with hundreds of people each day, highlighting the necessity for the workers to be completely healthy when they clock in, so they don’t spread the virus while at work. Thus the city’s officials and social scientists recognized our problem of needing multiple free testing centers.

(People wait in line to receive a free Covid-19 test in Boston, MA.)   (People wait in line to receive a free Covid-19 test in Boston, MA.)   
Photo by Jakayla Toney on Unsplash .Unfortunately, those faced with the task of solving this problem did not begin with empathy. The majority of our initial free testing sites were not accessible via public transit. For one reason or another, the majority of people in Boston with jobs deemed “essential” don’t own their own vehicle. So we had a solution to the problem (free testing sites), but the solution clearly failed to consider the physical restrictions of the people whose problem we wanted to solve. Had our city’s problem solvers begun with empathy, we could’ve avoided this mess. Thankfully, Boston’s officials quickly realized their mistake and worked to correct it. However, this example proves the need for any scientific process to begin with empathy. Good digital product design also begins with empathy. Fortunately for us designers, however, we have a lot less at stake than the transmission of a deadly virus. Let’s take a look at some examples.

When I first began my design career, I didn’t have many design projects under my belt, so I populated my portfolio with some sample projects and redesigns of existing products that I had made in my spare time. For one of these sample projects, I reimagined Wikipedia, specifically the article on our galaxy, the Milky Way.

(A redesign of Wikipedia that I made when I was first starting out as a designer.)   
(A redesign of Wikipedia that I made when I was first starting out as a designer.)   (A redesign of Wikipedia that I made when I was first starting out as a designer.)   
A design can be beautiful and artistic, but if it doesn’t begin with empathy, it won’t solve any problems.This design is pretty (in my humble opinion). It’s clean and organized. There’s plenty of room for the content to breathe. On the surface, my Wikipedia redesign might look like some good UI. But it is, in fact, utterly useless crap.

My Wikipedia redesign is crap because it didn’t begin with empathy. Wikipedia aims to deliver reliable information to even the most remote, information-starved locations with limited internet access. Wikipedia’s strength lies in its light weight and versatility. Democratizing information means that even the slowest internet connection should be able to access that information. My redesign would require a hefty style sheet. A massive header image and a dynamic table of contents widget would take a while to load, seriously limiting which users can access the site, effectively defeating Wikipedia’s entire purpose. I failed to account for my intended users’ physical limitations.

(A screenshot of Wikipedia’s main page.)   
(A screenshot of Wikipedia’s main page.)   (A screenshot of Wikipedia’s main page.)   
Wikipedia’s strength lies in its light weight and versatility.Like science, good UI/UX design begins with empathy. It requires a designer to intimately understand their users. As we saw with my Wikipedia redesign, focusing solely on the artistic aspects of your designs will inevitably lead to neglecting some of your users’ most important needs. An easy way to begin your designs with empathy is to conduct user interviews at the start of each project. Work with your clients or supervisors to identify your key user base and then contact people who identify similarly. Get to know your target audience by literally talking to them.

I mentioned earlier that occasionally Art has the power to empathize with and give a voice to underrepresented populations. I think that’s a beautiful quality. But did Jackson Pollock take the time to connect with his intended audience, intimately understand their greatest needs, and provide solutions to their problems in a way that empathized with their physical and cognitive limitations? I never met the man, but I’d guess he probably didn’t.

3. Good design follows the scientific method. 
Some of the greatest works of art began not with a hypothesis, but with inspiration. And while it’s important for a designer to have several sources of design inspiration, it’s simply not practical for every single website or app you design to begin with inspiration. I’m currently working with a client to design a financial reporting and aggregation tool. A product built by accountants, for accountants. No amount of time spent browsing Dribbble or watching sunsets will fill me with the monumental desire to design life-changing accounting software. Instead, good design should follow the scientific method.

Aside: Before I began my design business, I taught STEM classes at a middle school in Boston. So for this post, I’ll use the scientific method as taught to fifth graders. Some folks who studied the hard sciences in college might be familiar with more complex variants of the scientific method, but for design purposes, we don’t need much more than a 5th grade understanding.

(An image of with each step of the Scientific Method written on an index card.)   
(An image of with each step of the Scientific Method written on an index card.)   (An image of with each step of the Scientific Method written on an index card.)   
Good UI/UX Design follows the scientific method.The scientific method begins with a question. Remember that good UI/UX design solves problems. Your question should revolve around the problem you’re trying to solve. If, for example, your problem happens to be that users find it difficult to complete a form on your web application, your question could resemble “How do I design a form with less friction?”

Research constitutes the scientific method’s second step. The point here is to discern whether someone else has already solved our problem. Referring back to the poorly-converting form example, is there already an elegant solution for designing frictionless forms? If so, you can stop here. Study existing forms that convert at your target conversion rate and apply their techniques to your own forms. If, however, you face a previously unsolved problem, your research continues.

The second half of the research phase consists of user research. Talk to your users. Ask them what problems they perceive. Set up a screen-share session and observe your users attempt a form submission. You’ll pinpoint the exact instances of friction and thus narrow the problem.

Step three in the scientific method contains hypothesizing. We’ve identified a design problem by asking questions, we’ve researched potential solutions to the problem and we’ve researched why users encounter this problem. Now it’s time to brainstorm solutions. That’s solutionsssss, plural. A large number of beginner designers will stop here. They’ll design one solution and call it a day. They’ll send their single design to the client and collect their paycheck. But we’re only halfway through the scientific method so far. Stopping here severely limits the quality and efficacy of our designs (which could in turn limit the amount we charge for our designs).

The scientific method’s fourth step involves testing your hypotheses. You’ve brainstormed several potential solutions and now it’s time to test them, in a round of user testing. Use Invision or some other prototyping tool to place your new designs in front of users. If you want to get real scientific, separate your participants into several groups: a control group who uses the old/problematic design, and a group for each of your newly designed potential solutions. (Note: this strategy becomes implausible for small projects with a limited supply of users willing to participate in testing. Just do the best you can with the resources you have.) Again, ask users what problems they perceive and set up a screen-share session to observe how they interact with your new designs.

Steps 5 and 6 are pretty simple: analyzing the data and drawing conclusions. After conducting your user testing, it should become clear which of your prototypes performed the best. That’s the one you’ll want to tidy up and submit to your client. If it turns out that the old/problematic design performed better than any of your redesigns, that’s perfectly okay. Simply repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have a design that works.

Good digital product design follows the scientific method. If you want to charge good money for your work, you’ll need data and results to justify your rates. Adhering to the scientific method can equip you with that data. If you treat your designs like art, you’ll find yourself wasting chunks of time looking for inspiration when you could be following an actionable plan to success.

4. Good design is not subjective. 
I foresee heavy criticism from artists for the following paragraphs. I’m certain several folks who have attended art school or hold a music degree will tell me that art is very much not subjective. And they might be right; after all, it is possible to flunk out of art school.

However, when it comes to the art consumed by masses, personal taste dominates the market. For instance, someone who studied music at an advanced level might be able to explain why Punk Rock is overly simplified and takes less technical proficiency to master than some other genre. But at the end of the day, the guys from Green Day comprise some of the wealthiest people on the planet because they created art that millions of people subjectively enjoy. Similarly, the art that decorates my apartment I purchased out of subjective affinity. There exist no criteria or checklists for proving the quality of the paintings on my walls. I simply like the paintings.

Good design differs from art because massively successful designs are objectively good. In fact, UI/UX design can be measured against a set of criteria to determine its worth. A design’s success lies not in the personal preferences of its users; rather, a design’s success can be accurately predicted and measured based on whether it meets a set of standards.

(A scientist places an unknown substance into a machine for measurement.)   
(A scientist places an unknown substance into a machine for measurement.)   (A scientist places an unknown substance into a machine for measurement.)   
Like science, good UI/UX Design is objective and its success can be measured. Photo by Satheesh Sankaran on Unsplash .Author and designer Michael Cummings makes the distinction that “[good] design is a craft of service, not self-expression.” He suggests that the key difference between design and art is the people it serves. Since most folks generally consider art as a means of expression, art tends to serve its creator. But since design strives to serve a set of users by solving a problem, it inherently bears an air of objectivity; the design either solves that problem or it doesn’t.

Design is a craft of service, not self-expression. — Michael Cummings, UX design.com

Designer Bronwen Rees offers a similar argument for Toptal.com. She writes, “although a design outcome can be artful,” the design process shares very little in common with art. On one hand, Rees continues, art “aims to aesthetically express personal ideas or feelings through a particular medium.” Design, on the other hand, constitutes “ the result of a number of decisions made by one or more designers trying to solve a specific problem relative to a user; it is then evaluated simply by how successful it is at solving that problem. If unsuccessful, then the design has failed.”

So if good UI/UX design is objective, and we can measure it, what criteria should we use for measuring our designs? How do we know if they’re good?

The Short Answer: If your design solves the problems you intended to solve, it’s a good design.

The Medium Answer: In an article for the Interactive Design Foundation (the largest online design school in the world), author Euphemia Wong lists ten guidelines for successful user interface design. If a design can’t meet a majority of these guidelines, you can objectively conclude the design will fail. I personally recommend bookmarking Wong’s article if you’re new to design and desire an actionable checklist for your designs.

The Long Answer: Don Norman, the man who coined the phrase “User Experience” back when he worked at Apple, and Jakob Nielsen, another UX pioneer, built a free library of UI and UX resources and posted them to their website . The Nielsen Norman Group have compiled hundreds of heavily researched articles meant to provide digital product designers everywhere with the tools to craft highly successful interfaces and experiences. I recently read an article titled, “113 Design Guidelines for Homepage Usability,” which you can find here . Although an incredibly useful guide, the article’s length can prove rather dizzying. If you’re a designer looking to up your skills, I highly recommend spending some time on the Nielsen Norman Group website. You’ll find endless resources and checklists for reviewing and improving your designs.

Good UI/UX design is a science because, like many other scientific fields, it aims for objectivity and its results can be measured. Although the design process can yield a profoundly artistic result, the design process constitutes an entirely scientific procedure.

5. Good design can be taught. 
Perhaps one of the longest debates in the art world, the question of whether art can be taught. I think a case can be made for both sides. A student can learn proper paintbrush techniques. A student can learn how to operate a camera. A student can learn music theory. But painting a masterpiece, capturing compelling images, and composing a truly remarkable piece of music often necessitates some level of intrinsic talent. Remarkable UI/UX Design, on the other hand, requires no natural-born genius. Just like the world’s greatest scientists, the world’s greatest designers acquired their skills through extensive study. To prove my point, let’s examine the work of two world-renowned scientists and two world-class design agencies.

First, let’s take a look at the careers of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Jennifer Doudna. Both of these scientists were born naturally gifted. There’s no disputing the inherent brilliance of each of these two scientists. But Tyson didn’t come into this world with an intimate knowledge of astrophysics. He studied the heavens at Harvard, the University of Texas, and Columbia. He conducted research at Princeton. Tyson’s intellect? A natural born gift. Tyson’s familiarity with the cosmos? An acquired knowledge.

The same logic holds true for Jennifer Doudna, who won the 2020 Nobel prize in chemistry for her work in gene editing. Although Doudna has always been an incredibly gifted in an intellectual sense, she was not born with the knowledge that CRISPR-Cas9 could be used for programmable editing of genomes. Instead, she learned about biochemistry at Pomona College and Harvard Medical School.

Jennifer Doudna, recipient of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.Like remarkable scientists, great designers can acquire their skills through study. Anyone can internalize the criteria for good UI/UX design, and anyone can practice their craft until their designs meet those criteria. The design agencies Elegant Seagulls and Clay Agency exemplify the quality of output to which a designer can aspire, if they put in the effort.

Both Elegant Seagulls and Clay have won Webbies and Awwwards for their design innovation. But I can guarantee you that none of the designers on staff for either agency knew about the Rule of Thirds or how to build responsive websites from birth. Unlike history’s greatest artists, the greatest designers honed their craft through study, practice, and trial &amp; error.

UI/UX Designer Erik Kennedy (who has designed for folks like Amazon and Soylent) wrote an incredibly powerful article about his journey to mastering good design (and the specific techniques he learned and applies to every design). In the article, Kennedy mentions that the majority of his journey consisted of “being bad and then deliberately practicing.” He says good design can be learned through “cold, hard analysis.”

I learned [design] the same way I’ve learned any creative endeavor: cold, hard analysis … from being bad and then deliberately practicing. — Erik Kennedy 

Good design can be taught. In fact, learning constitutes the only way a designer can get good. When digital product designers treat their work as though it’s art, we snub the countless hours we’ve spent studying, practicing, and failing as we worked our tails off to obtain our skills. Don’t discredit your struggle by allowing your work to coalesce into a subjective art form. Treat your design work like the objective science it is.

<ami:content>Cette sanction financière est une première à l&apos;encontre d&apos;une chaîne d&apos;information, a précisé le CSA à l&apos;AFP.  

Le 29 septembre, lors d&apos;un débat de l&apos;émission &quot;Face à l&apos;info&quot; consacré à la question des mineurs isolés après l&apos;attentat devant les ex-locaux de Charlie Hebdo, Eric Zemmour avait déclaré: &quot;Ils n&apos;ont rien à faire ici, ils sont voleurs, ils sont assassins, ils sont violeurs, c&apos;est tout ce qu&apos;ils sont, il faut les renvoyer et il ne faut même pas qu&apos;ils viennent&quot;.  

Une sortie qui avait suscité un tollé et l&apos;ouverture d&apos;une enquête du parquet de Paris pour &quot;provocation à la haine raciale&quot; et &quot;injures publiques à caractère raciste&quot;, peu après une condamnation du polémiste pour les mêmes motifs.  

(L&apos;Express Abo)   
Offre limitée. 2 mois pour 1€ sans engagement 
Je m&apos;abonne 
 
&quot;Quand bien même ces propos ont été tenus dans le cadre d&apos;un débat en lui-même légitime (...), ils ont été de nature à inciter à la haine envers les mineurs étrangers isolés, et ont véhiculé de nombreux stéréotypes particulièrement infamants à leur égard, de nature à encourager des comportements discriminatoires&quot;, justifie le CSA dans un communiqué.  

&quot;Par ailleurs, le Conseil a estimé que la maîtrise de l&apos;antenne n&apos;avait pas été assurée, d&apos;autant plus que l&apos;émission a été diffusée en différé et sans modification, ainsi que l&apos;a souligné le comité d&apos;éthique du groupe Canal+ dans son avis rendu le 22 octobre 2020&quot;, ajoute l&apos;autorité audiovisuelle.  

La chaîne a ainsi &quot;manqué à ses obligations&quot;, estime le CSA, qui avait confié les saisines relatives à cette séquence à un rapporteur indépendant, CNews ayant déjà été mise en demeure pour des faits similaires fin 2019.  

Le CSA avait à l&apos;époque délivré un avertissement à la chaîne après des propos de sa vedette Eric Zemmour sur l&apos;islam et la colonisation de l&apos;Algérie.  

La sanction de jeudi n&apos;est pas une première pour le groupe Canal+: le régulateur a déjà condamné plusieurs fois C8 pour des séquences polémiques dans des émissions de Cyril Hanouna, avec notamment une amende de 3 millions d&apos;euros en 2017 pour un canular jugé homophobe.  

Une autre sanction, une privation de publicité d&apos;une semaine pour l&apos;émission &quot;Touche pas à mon poste&quot;, avait été annulée par le Conseil d&apos;Etat, obligeant le CSA à indemniser C8 à hauteur de 1,1 million d&apos;euros.

<ami:content>An emergency field hospital with tents customarily used for disaster relief has been opened in New York’s Central Park, and across the globe, “social distancing” has become part of our everyday behavior.

We are coming to grips with COVID-19, but it has caught us off guard. As most of the world’s population is under some form of lockdown, we find ourselves in the middle of an unprecedented social experiment with many people working remotely and entire families staying home.

A global pandemic of this scale was inevitable. For years, we have been warned of the possibility by hundreds of health experts, and in 2015, Bill Gates talked about how unprepared we are in his TED talk . He grimly warned: “If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.” We are now faced with a challenge that has no parallel in peacetime this century.

  
    
(Image by Sumanley xulx from Pixabay )While most people manage to “keep calm and carry on,” friction and frustration are inevitable living under such a crisis. But duress lays fertile ground for innovation, and during times such as these, eager designers and creatives can’t help but see opportunities for improvement.

If we approached COVID-19 as a design problem, could we find innovative ways to apply design thinking and human-centered design principles to help soothe everyday frustrations and mitigate the most pressing issues? Drawing parallels between the problems of the global pandemic and those of product and service design, the similarities are obvious.

At the intersection of the innovator’s mindset and creative thinking, we could explore ways to help the world deal with this and the next pandemic. Reaching into our designer’s toolkit, we could deploy the staples of our craft, including problem definition, ethnographic research, ideation, prototyping, and user testing. Taking advantage of recent innovations and the latest technology, we could run Design Sprints, focus on a specific problem, generate multiple solutions, build prototypes, and get rapid feedback.

  
    
The six phases of the design thinking process.The Design Thinking Process Applied to COVID-19 
A global pandemic puts enormous stress on governments and healthcare services. Suddenly, there is a scramble to circulate the correct information and roll out products and services to deal with the crisis. These challenges bring together a blend of product design, experience design, and service design problems that are desperate for a solution, and design thinking can help.

Design thinking is a methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It combines what’s desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically feasible and economically viable. It’s useful in tackling loosely defined, complex problems by understanding human needs.

Design thinking is unique compared with other forms of problem-solving methods in that it’s a non-linear process focused on delivering outcomes, rather than being focused on a precise problem definition. The design thinking process consists of five stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Each step needs to be given appropriate resources and the proper duration to create an end product that reliably meets user needs.

  
    
Information Clarity, Consistency, and Distribution 
The flow of information is essential to curbing a pandemic. While the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading, it took authorities several weeks to consolidate their messaging and make it consistent. With advanced technology, the distribution of information isn’t the problem. It’s transmitting the right information to the right people at the right time.

In times of crisis, there is an acute need for standardized, consistent, and effective information design. Principle four from the Nielsen Norman Group’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design states: “Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.”

To contain the outbreak, the UK government quickly moved to design clear, consistent messaging, taking advantage of the rule of three : “ Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives. “ It was widely distributed via the internet and media. People received texts, got emails, and saw posters on the street, all of which have proved to be very effective.

  
    
Consistent government messages appeared across the internet and streets in the UK.Unfortunately, not all governments are created equal, and too little came too late from too many. Particularly when lives are at stake, clear and consistent instructions from healthcare services and authorities need to be out sooner rather than later.

In an ideal scenario, an emergency “design commission” with an army of volunteer designers and content strategists could spring into action to rapidly craft and test various designs. Taking the design thinking phases of empathize, define, and ideate, this rapid response team of designers could assist authorities with formulating the right kind of messaging.

During the final phase of design thinking: implementation, governments could text millions of people with new rules around social distancing with the help of mobile operators. Getting information out rapidly over a variety of channels would ensure people receive the right kind of information promptly.

  
    
More than 60 million people received coronavirus text alerts from the UK government during the COVID-19 crisis.The primary goal of content strategists and information designers working with healthcare services is not only to convey vital information but to reduce people’s “cognitive load.” Borrowed from cognitive psychology, it is a frequently used term in UX and describes the process where, unable to process an overload of critical information, the brain shuts down.

Information designers can observe the Laws of UX and apply two of its “golden rules” to reduce cognitive load: Hick’s Law and Miller’s Law. Hick’s Law states that “the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices,” so minimalist, uncomplicated designs are best when people need to make a decision. For example, it could be applied to an infographic outlining whether to use facial masks or not.

  
    
A series of pictograms illustrate how to wash hands.In an extreme scenario, both of these laws could be violated simultaneously by confusing pictograms meant to convey vital information, i.e., presenting too many choices and asking people to remember too many things.

The third UX principle that could be adopted for powerful information design is the Von Restorff Effect , which can help people recall information more easily. It states that “items that stand out from their peers are more memorable.” Designers can use the Von Restorff Effect to design effective, memorable information that needs to be conveyed quickly and convincingly.

  
    
The Psychology of Panic Buying 
Experts say hoarding essential supplies despite reassurances from experts that shortages of everyday household goods are unlikely is motivated by a natural human reaction to stress and uncertainty.

When crises occur, people quite naturally want to regain control. We tend to run with the herd, thinking: “If everyone else is buying toilet paper, hand sanitizers, and pasta, I should probably do the same.”

How can stores prevent or at least get ahead of this kind of behavior? Reflecting on the principles of UX design, it’s about “knowing your user.” Becoming keenly aware of previous events, patterns, and behaviors that lead to the raiding of aisles in supermarkets and pharmacies could mitigate the problem.

  
    
A supermarket in Australia in the midst of panic buying.Aligning the panic-shopping phenomenon with the user interface heuristic “visibility of system status,” clear signage throughout the shopping experience could curtail the rush to stock up on essentials. Governments could raise awareness through the media and send uniform signage to grocery stores to calm nerves and inform shoppers that there is plenty to go around.

If there is a principle that is sacred to UX designers, it’s ‘know your user.’ After all, how can we design something for people without in-depth, detailed knowledge of them? Don Norman , co-founder and Principal Emeritus of Nielsen Norman Group

  
    
Supermarket signage and social media postings in the UK that help discourage panic buying.Product and Service Design in the Age of COVID-19 
Effective solutions are desperately needed to a myriad of problems foisted on the world by COVID-19. As a result, the pandemic is powering innovation on an atypical scale and pace not normally considered. Apart from PPEs (personal protective equipment), hospital beds, and face shields, ventilators are in short supply, which has sparked an astounding number of design breakthroughs. And that’s just one area where necessity has proved itself to be the mother of invention.

Innovation is now recognized as the single most important ingredient in any modern economy. Tom Kelley, IDEO Partner

Self-diagnosis at home, monitoring those who are infected, widespread testing, and contact tracing are just a few design problems that need solving. Dealing with emergent mental health issues, panic buying, and social distancing caused by lockdowns is another. Endless design problems with unique challenges present themselves during global crises, and exciting design opportunities abound.

Fusing advanced technology with design thinking, designers have an opportunity to bring forth many innovative products and services.

In the battle to contain the contagion, employing the test, trace, and treat approach is unavoidable. Widespread testing and contact tracing are needed to identify and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with the coronavirus.

Putting into practice the user-centered design process, designers could brainstorm new ideas with the “ how might we ” method. It would require us to accept that we don’t currently know the answer and foster a collaborative approach to solving it. IDEO calls it “ challenge mapping ,” which is very similar to the 5 Whys method for problem-solving (developed at Toyota in the 1930s).

For example, currently, home test kits are not reliable for testing for novel coronavirus infection. But the steps in the design thinking process could be applied to make them ready for the next one.

Under empathizing and defining, we can understand the problem; with ideation and prototyping, we can explore the most cost-effective way to make them; and with testing and implementation, we can refine and deliver an effective solution. In this way, millions of home test kits could be designed, prototyped, and tested.

  
    
A contact-tracing app.Mobile apps and big data are ideal partners for contact tracing. When people develop symptoms, how can they know if it’s COVID-19? An AI-powered COVID-19 symptom checker app could “listen” to coughs and breathing, as well as measure body temperature and heart rate via an external wristband. Comparing results with large sets of previous data, it would come up with a diagnosis. Once the symptoms are confirmed, the app can then advise users on an appropriate course of action.

Looking at social distancing, apps could be designed that alert people if they’re getting too close to someone. It could be wearable tech, such as a chest camera, that would send an audible alert to their mobile device (or their earphones).

  
    
Social distancing could be made easier with wearable technology.COVID-19 and Mental Health — Living in Isolation 
As authorities race to stem the spread of the coronavirus by shuttering everything we take for granted, some experts fear the consequences on people’s mental health, and the longer a quarantine continues, the greater the effect.

Experts say that depression, anxiety, and suicides typically emerge from traumatic events, such as widespread lockdowns and the uncertainty of the pandemic. The impact is worse for those with existing mental health conditions, the elderly, the vulnerable, and the self-isolating.

Eight to 10 days after they were quarantined due to the spread of COVID-19, more than half the participants in a recent study reported the adverse psychological effects of the outbreak as “moderate or severe.” Can design thinking address people’s protracted isolation and look for ways to alleviate mental stress?

We can take steps from the design thinking process and approach problems from the user’s perspective: empathize with sufferers and ideate solutions. Healthcare services could support the availability of high-quality, remote counseling by therapists, psychiatric nurses, and doctors. However, the ease of use (usability) of these digital services is crucial, as well as the simplicity of making an appointment.

  
    
For many people, talking to friends and family over video calls helps. However, according to Jakob Nielsen of the Nielsen Norman Group, the elderly are typically not tech-savvy users and “need dramatically simplified software” that works with a push of a button. For them, making a video call needs to be almost as simple as using a lightswitch.

To help detect depression, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers have recently developed an AI system that can detect if a person is suffering from depression by analyzing their speech patterns. Such an AI system can power a mobile app that monitors a person’s speaking patterns, detects mental distress, and sends an alert to doctors. It could prove especially useful for those who can’t get to a doctor for an initial diagnosis due to distance, cost, or a lack of awareness that something may be wrong.

Designing Better Personal Protective Equipment 
When stepping out of home isolation, protection is on everyone’s mind. During lockdowns, people still need to get essential supplies, pick up medication, and get some exercise.

As designers approach the new norms and apply design thinking to personal protection, a window of opportunity opens up for design innovation. We can empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, and implement. For example, designers could envision washable gloves made of comfortable material that offer sufficient protection and would become part of our daily protective wear.

For those with a smartwatch, using haptic vibration, apps could sound an alert as the wearer is about to touch their face. Fashionable face masks that are easy to manage yet block airborne viruses could be designed.

In any healthcare system, there are not only the patients to consider but their families, the doctors, nurses, and other support personnel. A holistic system including all its components needs to be considered in order to see where design can help.

It’s putting the person, the human at the centre of what you do. Because no matter what industry or sector you’re in, there’s a human in there somewhere, so just anticipate and consider their needs. Kathryn Townsend, Head of Customer &amp; Client Accessibility, Barclays UK

During the ideation phase in design thinking, it’s unlikely the ultimate solution to the problem will be discovered. The point is to come up with as many ideas as possible, sort through them to find the best ones (which will likely be some combination of user needs, practicality, cost-effectiveness, and other factors specific to the project), and then figure out which ideas should move on to the next step: prototyping.

The idea is to try everything, even if some turn out to be duds.

I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work. Thomas Edison

As intensive care units are overwhelmed, there is an acute shortage of ventilators. Some ventilator manufacturers are forming partnerships with various firms and working around the clock to make them as fast as possible. Hope is also riding on smaller design labs that could make ventilators more quickly.

With ideation and prototyping, a team led by University of Oxford professors along with a student and professors from King’s College of London have defined a simple, safe, and scalable ventilator design that meets the strict specifications for use with patients. The design exploits off-the-shelf components and equipment with parts that can be produced using 3D printing, cutting costs dramatically.

“In less than two weeks, the students, researchers, and academics driving this project have developed into a highly structured and efficient team, brainstormed a prototype, and won government backing,” professor Mark Thompson of Oxford said.

Naturally, people fear contact with anything when a tap on a screen or keypad can cause a fatal infection. Touch-based UIs are not favored, and paying with cash isn’t permitted in many grocery stores. Out are ATMs, supermarket keypads, and vending machines; in are contactless transportation passes and payment terminals where people can use contactless cards, ApplePay, and Google Pay.

And then there is radar tech like Google’s Project Soli for contactless interactions.

Project Soli is developing a new interaction sensor using radar technology. The sensor tracks sub-millimeter motions at high speed and accuracy. It fits onto a chip, can be produced at scale, and built into small devices and everyday objects. Soli is a miniature radar that understands human motions at various scales: from the tap of a finger to body movements.

  
    
Google’s Project Soli , “an interactive hemisphere that can sense and understand movements.”Contactless payment terminals are already here, but soon, using radar-powered motion sensors, contactless UIs should be possible for everything from ATMs to vending machines. Interacting may be slower with these UIs, but “contactless-modes” will be safer to use. When there is no longer a need, systems can switch back to touch-based interactions.

Shopping for essentials in contactless stores would be a boon during global pandemics. Computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning systems can enable checkout-free shopping experiences. Are checkout-free stores like Amazon Go Grocery ahead of their time?

Putting cities under lockdown is not enough. Testing, contact tracing, home isolation, and rapid treatment are vital-all of which generate a lot of unstructured data. A sea of data coming in is good, but data alone doesn’t speak and doesn’t help make informed decisions. It’s tantamount to drinking from a firehose.

Policymakers and hospital leaders need to make informed decisions based on facts backed by data. For systems to function well, we not only need data but more importantly, robust data analysis and data visualization tools. Again, “ visibility of system status “ takes on vital importance. Patterns need to be identified, the spread of the virus visualized, and disease conditions monitored 24/7.

To facilitate better decision-making, researchers and startups are using artificial intelligence and other technologies to predict where the virus might appear next and how fast it will spread. These AI tools may use advanced technology and algorithms, but many of them suffer from poor usability. They need to be well-designed, present data efficiently, and communicate complexity with clarity through sophisticated data visualization.

UX designers have an opportunity to step in and make improvements. Once again, they can turn to the design thinking process: define the problem, ideate solutions, prototype, test, and implement the next generation of data visualization tools.

<ami:description>The six phases of the design thinking process.The Design Thinking Process Applied to COVID-19 A global pandemic puts enormous stress on governments and healthcare services.
In an ideal scenario, an emergency “design commission” with an army of volunteer designers and content strategists could spring into action to rapidly craft and test various designs.
Taking the design thinking phases of empathize, define, and ideate, this rapid response team of designers could assist authorities with formulating the right kind of messaging.

<ami:content>Son chanvre (« cannabis » en latin) dépourvu de THC, la molécule psychotrope, la « militante » le fait pousser sur les pentes de la Drôme provençale, à Bouvières, sur les terres de la Ferme du Faucon où broutaient encore des chèvres il y a cinq ans.

Le décès de son compagnon a conduit en 2016 cette « fille de la plaine » du centre de la France, installée dans la « montagne » drômoise il y a 25 ans, à tourner le dos à ses bêtes et au Picodon, le fromage de chèvre du coin. Trop lourd, seule avec ses deux enfants Marius (21 ans aujourd&apos;hui) et Félix (18 ans). « Les chèvres, c&apos;est 7 jours sur 7 ; il ne faut pas être malade ni dormir le dimanche matin. Le chanvre, lui, ne crie pas », image-t-elle auprès de l&apos;AFP.

Mais il peut attirer des ennuis. Si la quinquagénaire a le droit de cultiver son cannabis CBD, la molécule non psychotrope à laquelle sont attribuées des vertus relaxantes, elle ne doit pas commercialiser la fleur de la plante. Une impasse réglementaire qui interdit toute production française et que cette avant-gardiste a décidé d&apos;ignorer. Un choix osé. La Cour de justice de l&apos;Union européenne a rappelé en novembre que le cannabidiol, ou CBD, n&apos;est pas un stupéfiant et a jugé illégale la position de la France, qui interdisait jusqu&apos;ici d&apos;importer cette substance produite naturellement dans d&apos;autres pays européens. Mais elle n&apos;a pas tranché la question de la production.

La création d&apos;une filière agricole « made in France » agite l&apos;Assemblée. Mercredi dernier, un rapport parlementaire a officiellement réclamé « l&apos;autorisation de la culture (...) de toutes les parties de la plante de chanvre », y compris la fleur.

Si aujourd&apos;hui Nathalie Pagé n&apos;oublie jamais ses certificats et le résultat d&apos;analyse de son chanvre avant de se rendre sur le marché de Crest, à une quarantaine de kilomètres, pour vendre ses produits (huile, macérat, tisane, fleur...), cinq ans en arrière le paysage juridique était encore moins favorable. « C&apos;était &quot;ça passe ou ça casse&quot;. Si tu ne prends pas de risques, tu ne fais rien. Les gens qui réussissent sont les gens qui n&apos;abandonnent pas », dit-elle entre deux bouffées tirées sur sa cigarette de CBD.

« Une plante diabolisée » 
L&apos;audace a ainsi fait de Nathalie Pagé, 52 ans, une agricultrice pionnière qui compte parmi les rares paysans français capables de vendre sa propre récolte de CBD: « la seule dont la fleur est bio », s&apos;enorgueillit-elle. Elle a récolté 1 700 plants l&apos;automne dernier, dont certains sèchent encore dans son hangar qu&apos;elle continue d&apos;appeler « la Fromagerie » en souvenir de son ancienne activité, et vise le double pour 2021.

« Regardée de travers » au départ, elle voit l&apos;intérêt croître autour de son chanvre, terme qu&apos;elle préfère à cannabis. « Pour différencier par rapport au (cannabis) psychotrope : quand on dit cannabis aux gens, ça leur hérisse le poil. » Au marché de Crest, de nombreux clients s&apos;arrêtent devant son stand, par curiosité ou pour acheter des tisanes ou huiles afin de soulager des douleurs, comme cette cliente pour sa mère de 98 ans. « D&apos;une plante généreuse, on a fait du chanvre une plante dangereuse, diabolisée. Il faut informer les gens, et surtout ne pas les tromper. Leur donner des produits qui les satisfont, leur font du bien, surtout en ce moment : les gens ont besoin de &quot;déstresser&quot; », explique-t-elle, assurant n&apos;avoir eu que des retours positifs sur ses produits.

Elle reçoit également de nombreux appels d&apos;agriculteurs « qui veulent se reconvertir dans le chanvre car leur activité bat de l&apos;aile ». À ces collègues qui « se meurent », elle vante l&apos;intérêt de ce chanvre CBD, « un produit de qualité qui permet de gagner sa vie sans voler les gens ». 

Cette convertie milite également pour le développement d&apos;une filière française de qualité. Contraintes par la législation, les boutiques spécialisées se fournissent auprès de producteurs étrangers, peu regardants selon elle. « On ne sait pas d&apos;où ça vient, ni ce qu&apos;ils mettent dedans. Nous, nous faisons du bio, nous avons une charte à respecter. »

<ami:content>La société américaine Coinbase, plateforme d&apos;achats et de ventes de cryptomonnaies comme le bitcoin, a annoncé jeudi qu&apos;elle fera ses premiers pas à la Bourse de New York le 14 avril, sous le symbole COIN (pièce de monnaie en français).

L&apos;entrée de Coinbase à Wall Street sur la plateforme Nasdaq sera une première pour une entreprise de devises virtuelles.

Comme prévu, le groupe utilisera la méthode de la cotation directe , et non une introduction en Bourse classique, et ne récupèrera en conséquence pas d&apos;argent frais.

&gt; Lire : Pourquoi les sociétés de la Tech optent pour la cotation directe 

Un chiffre d&apos;affaires à +136% en 2020 pour atteindre 1,14 milliard 
Mais les actionnaires déjà présents à son capital - les fondateurs, les employés et les investisseurs historiques - pourront vendre leurs participations sur le marché. Ce processus a déjà été utilisé par Spotify, Slack, Palantir ou Roblox.

Un prix de référence sera fourni la veille au soir de l&apos;opération.

La plateforme a été fondée en 2012 à San Francisco et fournit des services d&apos;achats, de ventes et de gestion de portefeuilles de cryptomonnaies.

Le groupe est en pleine croissance : son chiffre d&apos;affaires s&apos;est envolé de 136% en 2020 pour atteindre 1,14 milliard de dollars. Et la plateforme a gagné de l&apos;argent l&apos;an dernier: 322 millions de dollars après une perte de 30 millions en 2019.

Coinbase recensait 43 millions d&apos;utilisateurs particuliers fin 2020.

La société estimait alors avoir sur sa plateforme 90 milliards de dollars d&apos;actifs, une somme tirée par l&apos;envolée du bitcoin dont le prix a quadruplé en 2020 avant d&apos;exploser depuis le début de l&apos;année.

Les prix d&apos;autres cryptomonnaies comme Ethereum ou Litecoin ont aussi bondi ces derniers mois.

Quand l&apos;Europe se réveillera a écrit le 02/04/2021 à 16:08 : 
Va-t-on laisser nos monnaies nationales se faire uberiser. Est-ce que demain, je devrais payer en Bitcoin, Liteoin, Ethereum, DigiCoin ma baguette de pain.
Est-ce que le Bitcoin de viendra un état souverain ? Je ne vois pas la valeur qu&apos;apportent ses cryptomonnaies à la société, si ce n&apos;est l&apos;enrichissement personnel de quelques visionnaires. Pourquoi payer sa TESLA en Bitcoin et pas en dollar ? 
Est-ce que demain, un &quot;état Bitcoin&quot; sera capable d&apos;agir et d&apos;investir du Bitcoin pour supporter un pays en crise. Je ne crois pas. Ces monnaies alternatives sont comme Uber lors de son lancement qui visait à déréguler le marché des taxis. Bilans des courses, les uber-drivers deviennent maintenant des salariés comme les autres. 
Je suis preneur de comprendre ce qu&apos;apporte une crypto-monnaie par rapport à une monnaie classique, si ce n&apos;est une forme d&apos;évasion fiscale et de shadow monnaie.

<ami:content>Understanding how we get to know people in our personal life can teach us how to be better designers

  
    
Photo by Tatiana Vavrikova from PexelsFor my first assignment at university, I was assigned a partner, and told to come to the next lesson with a gift for them and then explain to the rest of the class why I had chosen it. I didn’t realise at the time, but I was about to be taught a lesson that has stayed with me ever since.

It didn’t seem like a difficult task, so I neglected it until the day the assignment was due. That morning however, when I started thinking about what to give my partner, I realised I had been set some serious homework. I didn’t know anything about them. What did they have already? What were they interested in? What made them laugh?

Ten minutes before the lesson started, I found myself in the university shop buying a notebook (because my partner was a student) and chocolate (because they were a human). Turning up to class, I felt a little ashamed of my efforts. My first week of university had been spent listening to teachers talk about how great designers create value for people by understanding latent needs, and here I was — about to present the most unimaginative gifts imaginable. I think my embarrassment during the presentation was obvious. The teacher didn’t need to say anything because the message was clear… If I wanted to create value for people, I would have to get to know them first.

Homer showing that he only really knows himselfWe thrive as innovators when we have a vivid picture of the people we are designing for in our minds. On the Master of Scale podcast , Airbnb founder Brian Chesky discusses how getting to know his customers is where his company’s success stemmed from, “It’s really hard to get even 10 people to love anything. But it’s not hard if you spend a ton of time with them.” Chesky was so committed to learning about his customers that if you were an early adopter of his service, it’s likely you would have met him. “We had their addresses and we say, ‘Knock knock. Hello. Hey, this is Brian, Joe, we’re founders and we just want to meet you.’ ”

When you know your customer you have a distinct advantage. Imagine if I was set the same gift-giving task but with a close friend. It would be much easier because I know what they own already; I know what makes them laugh; I know what music they actually enjoy listening to (despite what they might tell others). Because I have a rich image of them in my mind, it’s easy to predict their reaction to potential gifts. Spending time with people helps us build this picture.

But what specifically happens during that time that helps us get to know them?

The Stages of Learning About a PersonOne of the leading psychologists in the field of personality psychology, Professor J. D. Mayer, says that in order to form a vivid representation of a person in our mind, we must go through five stages of learning about them. This process starts with hearing about someone’s existence (learning from afar); meeting them and forming initial impressions (first impressions); witnessing their behaviour over time (ongoing observation); testing our understanding of their character (testing and checking); and then ending with a reliable representation (lasting memories). Why this is interesting for innovators is because Mayer’s framework doesn’t just describe what we go through naturally in our personal lives, but also what we go through during customer research.

  
    
Stages of Learning About a Person, Mayer, 2014 
Stage 1: Learning from AfarHearing of a person’s reputation and gaining context about their environment

In our personal life, we often aim to get an understanding of people before we meet them — essentially to see if it’s worth the effort of getting to know them. This is done by listening to what other people say about them, or these days, by looking at their social media profiles.

In research projects, we can start in a similar way. In this case, we are making sure we identify the right people to start talking to. This is done by asking the client what they already know about their customers from past projects, and by studying existing consumer reports . This helps form an understanding of some of the basic facts about the customer and their environment; their age, gender, socioeconomic group and the trends that may be affecting their life.

Stage 2: First ImpressionsAttending to a person’s outward appearance and other observable characteristics and signals

To find out if a person is someone we are going to get on with, we meet them and see first-hand how they present themselves to the world. From the first meeting onwards, we will do this by listening to how they talk and by observing their body language. Are they shy? funny? serious? What do they like to talk about? What do they think about certain topics?

In design research, we also start to deepen our knowledge by directly interacting with the customer. In this case, not to figure out if we like them, but to figure out if there is potential for them to like us. Through exploratory interviews and surveys , we start to understand how they see themselves, their attitudes to the world, and their current experiences in it.

Stage 3: Ongoing ObservationMonitoring a person’s actions and examining any discrepancies between their appraisal and their behavior

By the end of stage 2 we know some facts about a person, and how they see themselves and their world. However, we don’t yet know the deeper characteristics that influence their behaviour. By spending more time with them and observing how they act in different environments, for example, at a party vs. a nice restaurant we begin to learn this.

During this stage in design research, we also start building mental models of customer behaviour so we can begin to predict it. To achieve this we may shadow our customer, or run diary studies . We do these activities because unlike interviewing and surveying, it shows us things customers are unable to explicitly share about themselves.

Stage 4: Testing and CheckingTesting our predictions about a person’s behavior, changing how we act with the target and seeing how the target acts in response

To ensure our understanding of a person is correct we need to test the mental models we have of them. For example, if we think our new friend is a bit straightlaced, we can test this by asking them to sneak out of work for a cheeky pint with us. If they say yes, we reform our model of them in our head to incorporate this behaviour.

With customers, we build prototypes to test our predictions about them. These can be low fidelity at this point as we are focusing on testing customers needs rather than design details. An example of this might be setting up a fake landing page and tracking the engagement to test our assumption that the customer has a need for our service.

Stage 5: Lasting MemoriesHaving key recollections of the person that we can readily call to mind

By this stage we have the feeling that we know someone well. Even if they are not with us, we can imagine what that friend might say or do if they were.

By this point in a design project, the team should also have a working model of the customer (or customers); one that incorporates all the findings from the previous stages: basic facts, attitudes, behaviours and tested assumptions. To share this with the wider team they can create personas . It’s important to note that personas are not set in stone and should continue to evolve over time by revisiting these stages.

Get to know your customerIf you are wondering how well you know your customer, set yourself the task of buying them a surprise gift. If you are struggling to think of anything beyond the generic, you probably need to learn more about them. Using Mayer’s framework, you can see what activities you need to do to deepen your knowledge of your customer. The reward will be worth the effort because what’s true in our personal lives is also true in design: it’s the people who know us best that are able to bring us the most value.

“I didn’t ask for it… I just wanted it”

<ami:content>L&apos;âge pivot est-il réellement retiré de l&apos;avant-projet de loi sur les retraites  ? La réponse est simple : non. L&apos;&quot;âge d&apos;équilibre&quot;, comme l&apos;appelle l&apos;exécutif, figure toujours dans le texte. Le Premier ministre Edouard Philippe a seulement annoncé, samedi 11 janvier, aux syndicats le retrait à titre provisoire de la mesure de court terme , destinée à renflouer l&apos;équilibre des caisses de retraite à l&apos;horizon 2027. Cette mesure devait commencer à s&apos;appliquer en 2022 et portait progressivement à 64 ans l&apos;âge du départ à taux plein en 2027. Temporairement suspendue, elle pourrait être rétablie et l&apos;âge d&apos;équilibre doit de toute manière être mis en œuvre en 2037. Vous avez du mal à suivre ? C&apos;est normal. On vous explique, étape par étape.

Age pivot, âge d&apos;équilibre, âge du taux plein 
Premier élément de compréhension : les journalistes parlent d&apos; &quot;âge pivot &quot;, mais l&apos;exécutif préfère les termes d&apos;&quot;âge d&apos;équilibre&quot; ou d&apos;&quot;âge du taux plein&quot;. Ces expressions sont synonymes. Cet âge pivot doit remplacer la durée de cotisation, dans le futur système de retraites voulu par le gouvernement. Dans son rapport rendu en juillet 2019 sur le système universel à points, l&apos;ancien Haut-Commissaire aux retraites Jean-Paul Delevoye préconisait de fixer cet âge &quot;à 64 ans au démarrage de la réforme, en 2025&quot;.

Sauf exceptions (carrières longues, métiers régaliens…), tout départ à la retraite avant d&apos;avoir atteint l&apos;âge requis entraînera une décote, qui serait de 5% a priori. Si un assuré part à l&apos;âge légal minimal de 62 ans, alors que l&apos;âge pivot est de 64 ans, sa pension sera amputée de 10% (il part deux ans plus tôt, donc il a un malus de 2 x 5% =10%).

L&apos;âge pivot ne sera peut-être pas mis en place dès 2022… 
Qu&apos;a annoncé le Premier ministre Edouard Philippe dans sa lettre aux syndicats publiée samedi 11 janvier ? Il s&apos;est dit prêt, comme l&apos;avait demandé le secrétaire général de la CFDT Laurent Berger, à renoncer à la mesure d&apos;âge pivot à court terme. En clair : il ne renonce pas à l&apos;&quot;âge d&apos;équilibre&quot; inscrit dans la réforme et prévu dans le futur système. Il suspend provisoirement son application dès 2022, mais il faut garder à l&apos;esprit que cette mesure a la préférence de l&apos;exécutif, qui garde la main sur l&apos;ensemble de la réforme.

Jusque-là, l&apos;âge pivot devait toucher des personnes qui ne seront pas concernées par le système par points : celles partant à la retraite entre 2022 et 2027, dont la pension aurait donc dû être calculée en combinant l&apos;âge pivot et le système actuel. Cette mise en place progressive est sortie de l&apos;avant-projet de loi.

Mais la conférence de financement a peu de solutions de rechange 
Edouard Philippe a toutefois posé une condition. A l&apos;occasion d&apos;une conférence de financement , proposée par la CFDT, les partenaires sociaux doivent proposer, d&apos;ici fin avril, des moyens de renflouer les caisses de retraite à l&apos;horizon 2027 (environ 12 milliards d&apos;euros). Pour cela, ils ne doivent recourir &quot;ni à la baisse des pensions, ni à la hausse du coût du travail&quot;. Impossible de proposer une hausse des cotisations, donc.

Les partenaires sociaux pourront recourir à un arsenal de mesures, à combiner à leur façon. L&apos;âge pivot reste une des solutions en lice, avec d&apos;autres dont la possibilité de modifier &quot;l&apos; âge d&apos;ouverture des droits&quot; à la retraite pour certains salariés . En dernier lieu, le gouvernement tranchera par ordonnance. Si les partenaires échouent à trouver un accord, &quot;le gouvernement, éclairé par les travaux de la conférence, prendra par ordonnance les mesures nécessaires&quot;. L&apos;âge pivot n&apos;est par conséquent pas totalement écarté pour 2022.

L&apos;âge pivot prévu pour 2037, au plus tard 
A long terme, le futur système universel à points comportera bien &quot;un âge d&apos;équilibre&quot;, a rappelé Edouard Philippe . Il constituera &quot;un des leviers de pilotage du système collectif dans la durée&quot;. La future Caisse nationale de retraite universelle, qui gérera le système, décidera des bonus-malus appliqués. &quot;A défaut, lors de l&apos;entrée en application du système universel de retraite, ils seront fixés par décret à 5% par an&quot;, précise le texte de loi.

Cet âge d&apos;équilibre concernera les générations nées à partir de 1975, qui basculent dans le système à points. Si l&apos;âge légal minimal de départ à la retraite est maintenu à 62 ans, elles pourront partir en 2037 au plus tôt. Mais l&apos;&quot;âge d&apos;équilibre&quot; les incitera financièrement à partir plus tard, en 2039 (à 64 ans), voire en 2040 (à 65 ans). 

Mais cette mesure peut aussi intervenir plus tôt. Car la Caisse nationale de retraite universelle, qui doit être créée en décembre 2020, aura un rôle de veille et d&apos;alerte sur l&apos;équilibre financier du système. En cas de risque, le gouvernement peut parfaitement décider, avant 2037, de réimposer l&apos;âge pivot, au nom de la règle d&apos;or exigeant l&apos;équilibre du système de retraite sur cinq ans.

This has been great, and without doubt raised the quality bar for modern digital products, but how do you make sure you’re staying laser focussed on your users all of the time, not just at the points where you’re getting feedback? Here is some practical advice.

Product managers and designers have to be best friends

If they’re not on the same wavelength, then I’m afraid it’s not going to work. Product needs to involve design right from the start, so that they all get the vision and context first hand. Product managers need to be able to articulate clear objectives and metrics to give designers the space to come up with creative solutions.

Think hard, so that you can get your UX as right as you can first time

Yes, you’re going to get real user feedback as early as possible but it’s important that the feedback is on your very best effort. I’ve worked with lots of larger companies where apathy has set in after a design workshop and the team have settled with whatever the least controversial design route is. “We’ll find out if it doesn’t work when we AB test it” is just a lazy approach to me. You should only select your very best option(s) because they are going to take effort to design, prototype or build. You really need to think hard about the user experience, not necessarily longer, but harder!

Get into the mind of the most impatient person you know

A lot of product managers will talk about designing for a parent or grandparent, as they’re unlikely to be as technically literate as you. Not bad advice, but I think it’s better to design for the most impatient person you know. They probably are technically literate but just want to get their stuff done as quickly as possible. People want to do stuff quickly in the real world, but they rarely have that pressure in a usability lab. If you can, try and get feedback from your impatient friend with a prototype. Impatient people will usually be very direct, swear lots and probably insult you, but they’ll give great feedback.

Optimise for the most important jobs for your target user

Seems obvious, but ruthlessly focussing on helping your users get their core job done and eliminating things that get in their way is vital. It’s also a great way of helping you prioritise when your product starts to mature — how does the shiny new feature you’re building help your user get their core job done? If it doesn’t, then it may be doing more harm than good.

Concentrate on the majority of your users

In larger companies where there are lots of stakeholders it’s easy to give undue weighting to edge cases, just because a particular stakeholder cares about them. Sure, your product needs to handle the edge cases, but it doesn’t need to expose minor features with the same weighting as core functionality.

  
    
Look at this early WhatsApp example. I’m guessing well over 95% of people will just tap on ‘Continue’.

The edge cases are covered, there are links to explain the subscription and ad policy, but I’m thinking only a handful of users will tap on these. Most of them will just want to get started and message their friends. WhatsApp have placed an appropriate level of emphasis on the buttons and links.

Text matters

If you have a copyrighter on the team, that’s excellent. Often it falls to the product manager to write all of the text that appears on the product. If it does, then this needs to be taken very, very seriously. Using the right wording can make the difference between something that people can use right away and something that causes lots of confusion. Do it properly and create a document articulating your tone of voice, with examples, before writing your copy.

Everyone’s a new user at the start

Everyone will go through your sign up journey so you need to make this as easy and frictionless as you possibly can. If they have problems the first time, they’re unlikely to ever come back again, so your first use experience deserves lots of attention.

If you can do without it, you probably should

Generally the less you have on your page or screen the easier it’s going to be for your users. It’s very easy to add too much functionality and features, less is usually more. You shouldn’t be dogmatic about this, there are always situations where an extra screen or more guidance text makes sense.

Using these techniques will help you build more user focussed products. They don’t in any way replace frequent prototyping and user testing, but they will help it be more effective.

<ami:content>A la tête du pays depuis 2015, John Magufuli, 61 ans, est officiellement mort mercredi de problèmes cardiaques, a déclaré la vice-présidente.  

Cette annonce a mis fin à près de trois semaines de spéculations sur son état de santé.  

- &quot;Justice immanente&quot; -  

Le chef d&apos;Etat n&apos;était plus apparu en public depuis le 27 février. Son absence avait alimenté les rumeurs, qui le disaient atteint du Covid-19, une maladie qu&apos;il n&apos;avait cessé de minimiser.  

Les autorités avaient démenti toute dégradation de son état de santé.  

&quot;Magufuli est mort du corona&quot;, le surnom donné au virus en Afrique de l&apos;Est, a affirmé un des principaux opposants, Tundu Lissu, dans une interview diffusée jeudi matin sur la chaîne télévisée kényane KTN.  

&quot;C&apos;est une justice immanente. Le président Magufuli a défié le monde dans la lutte contre le corona (...). Il a défié la science&quot;, a-t-il estimé, en assurant que le chef d&apos;Etat est mort &quot;depuis mercredi de la semaine dernière&quot;.  

Il est le deuxième dirigeant d&apos;Afrique de l&apos;Est à mourir dans des circonstances controversées après le président burundais Pierre Nkurunziza, également sceptique sur le Covid-19 et décédé des suites d&apos;une &quot;insuffisance cardiaque&quot; en juin dernier après que sa femme a été transportée au Kenya pour y être soignée du coronavirus.  

Plusieurs pays de la région (Kenya, Ethiopie, Rwanda, Burundi, Ouganda), l&apos;Union africaine ainsi que le Royaume-Uni et les Etats-Unis ont présenté leurs condoléances.  

- &quot;Bulldozer&quot; autoritaire -  

La Tanzanie, pays de 58 millions d&apos;habitants connu pour ses parcs naturels, l&apos;île de Zanzibar et le Kilimanjaro, est considérée comme un havre de stabilité dans une région particulièrement volatile.  

Surnommé le &quot;bulldozer&quot;, John Magufuli, était arrivé au pouvoir en promettant de lutter contre la corruption endémique dans le pays.  

Il a mené de grands projets d&apos;infrastructures, d&apos;électrification des campagnes, renégocié favorablement des contrats miniers et étendu l&apos;éducation gratuite.   

&quot;Les pauvres avaient commencé à faire des progrès, les affaires étaient florissantes. Si vous aviez un problème, le président vous écoutait&quot;, confiait jeudi matin, en pleurs, Kondo Nyumba, vendeur de journaux à Dar es Salaam.  

Mais ses années au pouvoir ont aussi été marquées par un virage autoritaire, dénoncé par des organisations des droits humains, avec des attaques répétées contre l&apos;opposition et un recul des libertés fondamentales.  

C&apos;est pourquoi un commerçant de Dar es Salaam, qui se présente sous le nom de William, n&apos;aura &quot;aucun regret&quot;. &quot;Je ne le pleure pas, je pleure les gens qui sont morts sous son régime&quot;, lâche-t-il.   

Sa réélection en octobre avec 84,39% des voix avait été dénoncée par l&apos;opposition comme une &quot;imposture totale&quot;.  

- &quot;Nouveau chapitre&quot; -  

&quot;On se souviendra plus de lui pour ce qu&apos;il a détruit (...) que pour tout ce qu&apos;il a commencé à construire&quot;, a estimé Thabit Jacob, chercheur tanzanien à l&apos;Université de Roskilde (Danemark), dans une réponse écrite à l&apos;AFP.  

Depuis un an, il avait constamment minimisé l&apos;impact du coronavirus.  

Ce fervent catholique avait affirmé que son pays s&apos;en était &quot;libéré&quot; grâce aux prières. Raillant la fiabilité des tests, il avait affirmé mi-2020 qu&apos;une papaye, une caille et une chèvre avaient été testées positives, et avait qualifié, en janvier, les vaccins de &quot;dangereux&quot;.  

Une posture devenue difficile à tenir ces dernières semaines alors que le pays fait face à une vague de décès imputés à des &quot;pneumonies&quot;, touchant jusqu&apos;à de hautes personnalités.   

Selon la Constitution tanzanienne, Samia Suluhu Hassan lui succédera &quot;pour la période restant du mandat de cinq ans&quot;.  

Le président du parti d&apos;opposition Chadema, Freeman Mbowe, a demandé à &quot;tous ceux qui ont une autorité légale de respecter les exigences constitutionnelles en ces temps difficiles&quot;.  

Il souhaite également voir &quot;ouvrir un nouveau chapitre pour la reconstruction de l&apos;unité nationale&quot;.  

Mais selon Thabit Jacob, Mme Hassan devra gouverner &quot;avec une base beaucoup plus faible, qui sera contrôlée par le clan Magufuli et les renseignements&quot;. &quot;Elle aura du mal à construire sa propre base et des rivalités entre factions vont émerger&quot;, prédit-il.

<ami:content>What we say:
“I like where you’re going, but I also wonder if we should explore…”

What we mean:
“I don’t like where you’re going.”

What ends up happening:
The designer, who was clearly going in the wrong direction, is never clearly told they were wrong, or what was wrong about it. A whole generation of designers grow up thinking they have always been right. And can’t understand when they end up receiving negative feedback later on.

What we say:
“What we’re showing here is just a high-level overview of what we’ve been exploring in the last two weeks, of course this will keep evolving.”

What we mean:
“We were not brave enough to make any decisions and/or to clearly state them on a slide. And although we had two weeks we were not thorough enough to finalize what we started. So we’ll just do a whole presentation avoiding strong point of views that could hurt our relationship in case you disagree with what we’re saying.”

What ends up happening:
The work gets pushed two extra weeks.

What we say:
“We’ve run some informal user testing sessions here in the office, and found out people were having a hard time identifying with what was on the screen.”

What we mean:
“I showed it to the guy who sits next to me and he didn’t like it.”

What ends up happening:
Nothing. Really.

What we say:
“I hear what you’re saying. We can definitely explore your suggestion as we refine the designs.”

What we mean:
“I don’t like your idea, sorry. I’ll pretend I try to incorporate your suggestions, and then I’ll come up with some random excuse for why it didn’t work out.”

What ends up happening:
Not a single pixel is moved.

Now in all honesty: indirect speech can help us feel better in the short term and avoid confrontational situations, but has a negative effect in the long run. Design is a team sport — and as any other team sport it requires trust and honesty amongst players. Naming a bad feeling what it really is forces you to confront it, and forces you, as a team, to learn how to overcome it.

Less euphemisms. More maturity. Please.

<ami:content>Le sélectionneur des champions du monde 2018 a dévoilé un groupe de 26 joueurs pour la réception de l&apos;Ukraine, le 24 mars au Stade de France, et le double déplacement à Noursoultan et Sarajevo, les 28 et 31 mars contre le Kazakhstan et la Bosnie-Herzégovine.  

C&apos;est trois de plus que les 23 autorisés sur la feuille de match (les joueurs surnuméraires restent en tribunes), de façon à anticiper tout forfait éventuel lié à des cas de Covid-19, une mésaventure récurrente depuis un an.  

Sauf contamination ou blessure, les incontournables Hugo Lloris, Paul Pogba, Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud et Kylian Mbappé seront sans surprise lundi à Clairefontaine pour le début du rassemblement, deux jours avant d&apos;affronter la &quot;Zbirna&quot; dirigée par l&apos;ex-Ballon d&apos;Or Andriy Shevchenko.

Ils y retrouveront notamment Ousmane Dembélé, l&apos;ailier gauche du FC Barcelone qui n&apos;a plus mis les pieds dans le centre d&apos;entraînement des Bleus depuis novembre 2018.  

- Areola de retour -  

Depuis, le champion du monde de 23 ans a enchaîné les blessures musculaires, les longues absences et les performances en dents de scie au Barça, avant de redevenir le dribbleur percutant pour lequel le club catalan avait investi plus de 125 millions d&apos;euros à l&apos;été 2017.  

&quot;Depuis plusieurs semaines, il enchaîne les matches, il a retrouvé ses capacités athlétiques, avec toujours cette capacité à faire des différences&quot;, a justifié Deschamps jeudi lors d&apos;une conférence de presse au siège de la Fédération à Paris.  

Un autre revenant retrouve Clairefontaine au meilleur moment: Ndombélé, 24 ans, profite de ses performances remarquées avec Tottenham et de l&apos;absence de Corentin Tolisso (Bayern Munich), grièvement blessé à une cuisse, pour revenir sous le maillot bleu plus d&apos;un an après sa dernière convocation, sans jouer, en novembre 2019.  

Thomas Lemar, le champion du monde de 25 ans, revient aussi pour la première fois depuis cette date. Après un passage à vide, l&apos;ex-milieu de Caen et Monaco affiche un niveau &quot;plus consistant depuis plusieurs semaines&quot; avec l&apos;Atlético Madrid, qui l&apos;avait recruté pour un montant record de 72 M d&apos;EUR en 2018, selon Deschamps.  

C&apos;est aussi en novembre 2019 que le gardien parisien prêté à Fulham Alphonse Areola (28 ans), rappelé jeudi, a vu les Bleus pour la dernière fois.  

- &quot;Pas de condamnés&quot; -  

Le &quot;come-back&quot; des quatre joueurs tombe à pic dans l&apos;optique de l&apos;Euro (11 juin-11 juillet), initialement prévu à l&apos;été 2020 mais reporté d&apos;un an en raison de la pandémie. La liste de mars devrait en effet grandement ressembler à celle des vingt-trois joueurs retenus pour le Championnat d&apos;Europe, que &quot;DD&quot; a dit vouloir dévoiler &quot;fin mai&quot;.  

Blessé dimanche avec Leipzig, le défenseur central Dayot Upamecano est contraint de faire l&apos;impasse en mars, mais le néo-international de 22 ans, conserve néanmoins une chance de disputer le tournoi paneuropéen.   

Ce sera plus compliqué pour Houssem Aouar, Jonathan Ikoné et Eduardo Camavinga. Les trois milieux prometteurs, déjà appelés chez les A mais absents cette fois, ont été convoqués lundi par Sylvain Ripoll pour disputer la première phase de l&apos;Euro-Espoirs, fin mars en Hongrie.  

&quot;Il n&apos;y a pas de condamné, il vaut mieux être dans la liste de mai&quot;, a toutefois nuancé &quot;DD&quot;. &quot;Les absents n&apos;ont pas forcément tort&quot;, a-t-il insisté.  

Parmi les &quot;absents&quot; de mars, figurent notamment les champions du monde Steven Nzonzi et Nabil Fekir, ainsi que le jeune attaquant Marcus Thuram (23 ans), auteur d&apos;un premier rassemblement prometteur en novembre avant de traverser une période plus compliquée avec Mönchengladbach.  

En raison de la pandémie de Covid-19, la Fifa a assoupli ses règles de convocation des joueurs pour la prochaine trêve internationale, autorisant les clubs à retenir leurs footballeurs si une quarantaine est obligatoire au retour. Mais à en croire Deschamps, cela ne devrait poser aucun problème aux Bleus.  

&quot;Les joueurs auront l&apos;obligation de venir directement à Clairefontaine (depuis leurs clubs). Ensuite, on se déplace en vol charter et le retour au club se fera de la même façon&quot;, a déclaré le sélectionneur, évoquant des &quot;accords avec les grands championnats&quot; où évoluent les Français pour qu&apos;ils soient immédiatement &quot;disponibles&quot; à leur retour en club.

<ami:content>&quot;Nous défendrons nos propres intérêts et nous travaillerons avec (les Américains) aux conditions qui nous seront avantageuses&quot;, a ensuite insisté Vladimir Poutine.  

Au-delà des échanges de piques, Moscou a clairement souligné que les remarques de M. Biden relevaient de l&apos;inacceptable.  

Fait inédit depuis 1998, le ministère russe des Affaires étrangères a rappelé son ambassadeur aux Etats-Unis pour des consultations sur l&apos;avenir de la relation russo-américaine, plongée dans &quot;l&apos;impasse&quot;.  

Car, selon l&apos;ambassade russe à Washington, les &quot;déclarations irréfléchies de responsables américains risquent d&apos;entraîner l&apos;effondrement de relations déjà excessivement conflictuelles&quot;.  

- &quot;Prix à payer&quot; -  

Le Kremlin a lui dénoncé des propos qui démontrent que M. Biden &quot;ne veut clairement pas améliorer les relations avec notre pays&quot;.  

Seul signe jusqu&apos;ici de désescalade, le département d&apos;Etat américain a assuré à l&apos;AFP qu&apos;il ne prévoyait pas de rappeler son propre représentant à Moscou.  

Dans un entretien mercredi à la chaîne ABC, en plus de sa réponse affirmative dépeignant Vladimir Poutine en &quot;tueur&quot;, M. Biden a voulu taper du point sur la table face au dirigeant russe.  

Il a dit vouloir lui faire &quot;payer&quot; l&apos;ingérence dans les élections américaines de 2016 et 2020. Moscou a toujours démenti ces accusations.  

Vladimir Poutine &quot;en paiera les conséquences&quot;, a prévenu Joe Biden, avant de répéter, après une relance: &quot;Vous verrez bientôt le prix qu&apos;il va payer&quot;.  

Ces propos ont été qualifiés par le président de la chambre basse du Parlement russe, Viatcheslav Volodine, d&apos;&quot;insulte&quot; aux Russes et d&apos;&quot;attaque&quot; contre son pays.  

Un vice-président de la chambre haute, Konstantin Kossatchev, a lui demandé &quot;des explications et des excuses&quot;.  

Les relations russo-américaines en particulier, et russo-occidentales en général, sont délétères depuis des années : annexion de la Crimée, guerre en Ukraine, conflit en Syrie ou encore l&apos;empoisonnement et l&apos;emprisonnement de l&apos;opposant Alexeï Navalny...  

- Coopération naissante menacée -  

De multiples trains de sanctions et contre-sanctions ont été adoptés en conséquence. Le gouvernement américain a annoncé mercredi encore qu&apos;il étendait les restrictions d&apos;exportation de produits sensibles vers la Russie.  

Jeudi, le G7 a lui une fois de plus dénoncé &quot;l&apos;occupation&quot; de la Crimée par la Russie.  

M. Poutine a répliqué à Joe Biden lors d&apos;une visio-conférence avec des représentants de la société civile de cette péninsule.  

Le président Biden affiche depuis son arrivée à la Maison Blanche en janvier une grande fermeté à l&apos;égard du Kremlin, par opposition avec la bienveillance souvent reprochée à son prédécesseur Donald Trump jusque dans son camp républicain.  

Mais la brusque dégradation des rapports russo-américains depuis l&apos;interview de mercredi pourrait menacer la coopération naissante sur des dossiers d&apos;intérêt commun.  

L&apos;exemple le plus marquant a encore été cité par M. Biden mercredi, à savoir le prolongement en début d&apos;année du traité de limitation des arsenaux nucléaires New Start.  

D&apos;autres sujets sur lesquels Russes et Américains tablaient sur des compromis pragmatiques sont le nucléaire iranien, les pourparlers de paix en Afghanistan ou encore la crise climatique, selon Moscou.  

Le président Biden a d&apos;ailleurs réaffirmé vouloir &quot;travailler&quot; avec les Russes &quot;quand c&apos;est dans notre intérêt commun&quot;.  

Mais la Maison Blanche a également insisté sur le fait que son locataire n&apos;allait pas pour autant &quot;taire ses inquiétudes au sujet de ce qu&apos;il considère être des actes néfastes&quot;.

<ami:content>AFP, publié le lundi 15 février 2021 à 17h45 

La justice a suspendu lundi les décisions du maire d&apos;extrême droite d&apos;une ville du sud-ouest de la France qui avait décidé la réouverture de quatre musées de sa ville, à l&apos;encontre des directives sanitaires du gouvernement.

Maire de Perpignan, Louis Alliot avait décidé le 8 février de rouvrir les quatre musées, sans attendre l&apos;avis du gouvernement concernant ces lieux fermés depuis fin octobre pour lutter contre la pandémie.

Mais un juge de Montpellier (sud), s&apos;appuyant sur un décret gouvernemental du 29 octobre ordonnant la fermeture nationale des musées et lieux culturels, a suspendu l&apos;exécution des décisions prises par le maire qui ne peut &quot;procéder lui-même&quot; à une telle ouverture, a précisé dans un communiqué le tribunal administratif, saisi en référé (procédure d&apos;urgence) par le préfet des Pyrénées-Orientales (sud).  

Le maire de Perpignan &quot;a méconnu les dispositions&quot; de l&apos;article 45 du décret du 29 octobre 2020 en autorisant l&apos;ouverture des quatre musées.

&quot;Nous regrettons cette décision qui éloignera encore un temps nos concitoyens durement éprouvés par cette crise sanitaire&quot;, a réagi M. Aliot sur Twitter.

&quot;La culture est un besoin essentiel qui ne demande qu&apos;à s&apos;exprimer&quot;, a t-il écrit.

<ami:content>(O)   Online Shopping has by now become a part of everyday life for millions of people and it only keeps growing. We can expect 19% growth in eCommerce sales this year alone. However, online shopping hasn’t even existed for that long (only 20 years or so). This creates huge challenges for designers. We are exploring a brand new frontier.

Every company has a unique business model. The products they sell, the size of their inventory, country, and shipping options all have an impact on the design requirements.

Designers working in eCommerce develop a certain skill-set that is unique. They must also understand marketing and development to a greater degree.

Let’s dig into what makes a great eCommerce designer.

1. Data analysis &amp; balance 
As a designer with a marketing background, I have to mention the importance of data gathering &amp; analysis. Many designers choose a pretty UI over functionality and user behavior. And for eCommerce, this is a fatal mistake.

In online shopping, the customer is king. You need to understand how your customer thinks, scrolls, reads, reacts or browses. You need to make it as easy as possible for your target customers to buy your products.

If you are redesigning an existing store, you’re in luck because you already have a wealth of information and existing customers that you can learn from. You have data from Google Analytics, which can help you with creating a buyer persona, understanding store audience, traffic sources, customer behavior, successful products, pain points, and conversion rates.

You can also use other tools to run session recording, heatmaps, sales analysis, create customer interviews/polls (if possible) and do competitor analysis. With session recording, you can actually look over the buyer&apos;s shoulder and watch their journeys.

PRO TIP: It’s easy to get lost in the amount of unstructured data. You need to find a balance between data &amp; common sense.

But what if you are designing a brand new store or you don’t have any data?

In that case, you need to do some good competitor analysis. The simplest way to do this is to Google similar products to find competitors and get to know their sites well. Go through the site as a customer would, search for products, filter products, add to cart, check out their social media, etc. You will see what kind of challenges they faced and how they decided to solve them.

Look at both small and large brands. Many of the larger brands have the money and resources for thorough UX testing. Many of the smaller brands know their customer very well.

‘‘Good artists copy; great artists steal.’’

— Picasso

2. Consider the need for speed 
Yes, you’ve heard this many times. But for eCommerce (especially for growing mobile eCommerce), this is critical.

Google’s mobile page speed study shows how the bounce rate rapidly grows when the website loads more than 3 seconds. And it affects sales — a 1-second delay in load time will cost you a 7% loss in conversions .

The design decisions you make are the basis for a quick loading speed. Developers can only do so much to reduce it. A fancy video background? 5 videos on a product page? This beautiful 3MB PNG image? There’s no way a developer can fix that. So keep this in mind when you design.

PRO TIP: Compress all your JPG images — e.g. using Squoosh . Use SVG for icons &amp; illustrations, instead of PNG.

3. Mobile eCommerce (mCommerce) 
By 2021, mCommerce sales are expected to reach 54% of total eCommerce sales . Moreover, Google has been prioritizing mobile-friendly websites since 2018.

But mobile commerce is more than just eCommerce on a mobile screen. It is an evolution that involves not only your store, but also mobile payments, mobile banking, location-based services, augmented reality (like the Sephora Product Try-On app), mobile AI, chatbots, and more.

The major advantage of mCommerce is a better omnichannel experience for customers. And it’s accessible everywhere for everyone — not everyone has a computer.

So, what can you do to be ready for mCommerce as a designer?

- Page speed optimization (yes, again)
- Mobile Navigation (e.g. bottom mobile menu, easy to access cart)
- Big accessible buttons (for our fat and short fingers)
- One-page checkouts and digital wallets (e.g. Amazon Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal One Touch) can seriously improve your mobile conversions.

4. Understanding the Customer Journey 
There are 5 main types of eCommerce shoppers . Understanding their differences can help you deliver a better experience for all of them:

- Product focused: They know exactly what they want and they want it quickly. It’s important to provide them with a great search experience, access to previously purchased items, smart filters (to help find products faster) and a fast checkout that has all the information pre-filled.
- Browsers: These are the more relaxed buyers — they browse different online stores, looking for trends, future purchases, inspiration or are just killing time. Top selling products, popular products, suggested products, new products, or the ability to share products are the most crucial features to convert them into buyers.
- Researchers: They are in the early funnel stage, they collect information about products &amp; prices, reading product and brand reviews. To turn them into buyers you have to win their trust, provide social proof, have a detailed product description &amp; high-res zoom-on-hover images, easy-to-edit shopping carts, and a good wishlist.
- Bargain hunters: They hunt for the best deal possible. What’s important for them is to find prices quickly and with no hidden costs. And they want to see how much they save on sales, coupons or special offers. Show them the numbers, quickly.
- One-time shoppers: They can play any of the roles above but we need to remember that they have a one-time need. What is critical for this type? They hate long registrations. Your journey should give them clear navigation, product description, company information (like shipping and FAQ), and most importantly — checkout without registration.

5. Simplicity 
You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. If something works well, don’t add unnecessary elements or decorations. eCommerce is not the right place for showing off your graphic design skills.

‘‘Good design involves as little design as possible.’’

— Dieter Rams

I use a simple rule to avoid useless elements. Just answer this quick question in 5–10 words: ‘‘How will it help get more sales?’’.

PRO TIP: Checking out bigger &amp; more successful competitors can be a great way of seeing what’s necessary and what isn’t. They have more data, traffic, experience, and resources to analyze, so they most likely take data-driven decisions.

6. Appreciate your customers time 
You know that feeling when you can’t find shipping options? Or the button leads you to an unexpected page? Or you had no idea how many steps the registration would take? Do you remember how frustrated, lost or even angry you were?

We have so little time in this world, our day is planned down to the minute. Customers deserve to know how much time the process of purchasing the product will take, how much it will cost, or what shipping options they have.

It’s critical to appreciate your customer’s time when you are designing their experience. Here are some ways to do that:

- Use progress indicators (for checkout, registration)
- Use clear &amp; relevant Call To Actions (CTAs)
- Make sure the website architecture &amp; links are clear e.g. example.com/category/product
- Design intuitive navigation, especially on mobile
- Make buying process information (like Shipping, Returns, FAQ) easy to find
- Highlight the product availability (it’s so sad to finally realize the product you choose is out of stock)
- Filters are essential for stores with 100+ products (e.g. I want to buy a red dress, don’t make me scroll 5 pages of black dresses)
- Good photography (even the best design looks bad with low-quality images) and zoom (I want to see it really close-up)
- Gamification (a great example — Chillys Bottles Personalizer . I lost 10 minutes, just applying different bottle designs).

7. Test, analyze, and test again 
What have I learned so far from my marketing &amp; design experience? There are no absolute rules. Yes, you can follow all the possible best practices, but your audience is unique, and requires a unique experience. What can you do? Test and analyze!

Low fidelity testing is the quickest way to solve problems and find the right solutions for your audience. Start with prototypes and discuss them with the store owners, your colleagues, friends, and trusted customers (if possible). The most important thing here is to separate good feedback from personal tastes.

PRO TIP: For small stores with unique products, store owners know their audience pretty well. And they can be a good advocate for their customers. So, it’s important to listen to their opinion and business goals.

If you are working on improving an existing store, you need to understand how to choose the right key performance indicators (KPIs) to track &amp; analyze your changes. The essentials are:

- Sales Growth: Total sales and sales per channel during different seasons, months, years.
- Conversion rates: Mainly visitors to sales, abandoned carts, conversion rate by marketing channel.
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC): How much does it cost to attract one customer, and CAC by marketing channel.
- Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who enter the site and then leave without viewing other pages.
- Average order value

Changes in these KPIs are great indicators for a quick customer experience health-check.

For example, after adding a popup to the website we see the bounce rate has grown. After a small investigation (e.g. checking session recordings), we understand that it’s impossible to close it on mobile. After redesigning the mobile popup, the bounce rate improves. No polls or interviews needed, just KPIs.

The testing process can be iterative and involve really small changes (like font size, button color, content order). After each change, you should check the main KPIs &amp; behavior changes. This approach of quick hypothesis testing is known as Growth Hacking .

Always remember that the customer journey is not finished even when the sale is complete. After that, there are still many steps to turn your buyers into brand advocates. Don’t forget to send a great order summary with shipping details, update your customer on status changes, and bring them back to buy more.

Keep your eyes on the prize 
Designing for eCommerce is an exciting field to be in.

Making things beautiful is nice, but how do you really know if you are a good designer? Can you measure the value of your work?

In eCommerce, you can. The results of your design skills are reflected in the earnings of the store. This is what makes it so exciting, and I can honestly say, I love eCommerce design.

“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”

— Steve Jobs

<ami:content>Au sein d&apos;un groupe où aucun cadre majeur ne fait défaut, le patron de l&apos;équipe de France offre une chance au Barcelonais et au joueur de Tottenham, ainsi qu&apos;à Thomas Lemar, à moins de trois mois de l&apos;Euro, pour affronter l&apos;Ukraine au Stade de France le 24 mars avant des déplacements au Kazakhstan le 28 et en Bosnie le 31.  

Dembélé (23 ans, 21 sélections) signe son grand retour en Bleus, lui qui a multiplié les blessures depuis sa dernière cape en novembre 2018.  

&quot;Ousmane enchaîne les matches, a noté Deschamps, il a retrouvé ses capacités athlétiques avec cette capacité à faire des différences, marquer des buts... Il a retrouvé le niveau qu&apos;il avait.&quot;  

(L&apos;Express Abo)   
Offre limitée. 2 mois pour 1€ sans engagement 
Je m&apos;abonne 
 
L&apos;autre retour à souligner est celui du milieu de Tottenham Ndombélé (24 ans, 6 sélections), plus apparu sous le maillot aux deux étoiles depuis le mois de juin 2019.  

Comme lors des derniers rassemblements, Deschamps a choisi de bâtir une liste élargie, avec 26 joueurs dont quatre gardiens de but, ce qui permet à Alphonse Areola d&apos;accompagner le trio habituel Lloris-Mandanda-Maignan.   

Incertains car blessés ou en phase de reprise, Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial et Kingsley Coman sont bien dans la liste. En revanche, Corentin Tolisso, éloigné des terrains pour plusieurs mois, est, comme prévu, le grand absent de ce rassemblement.  

Parmi les jeunes prétendants, Dayot Upamecano est blessé et donc logiquement laissé de côté. Quant à Eduardo Camavinga, Houssem Aouar ou encore Jonathan Ikoné, déjà sélectionnés, ils porteront le maillot des Espoirs lors de l&apos;Euro des moins de 21 ans, après avoir été convoqués par le sélectionneur Sylvain Ripoll en début de semaine.  

Sous Didier Deschamps, les listes des 23 joueurs amenés à disputer une grande compétition n&apos;ont jamais énormément différé de celles publiées en mars: les futurs 23 de l&apos;Euro en juin figurent probablement tous, ou presque, dans cette première liste de 2021.  

La liste des 26 joueurs:   

Gardiens: Alphonse Areola (Fulham/ENG), Hugo Lloris (Tottenham/ENG), Mike Maignan (Lille), Steve Mandanda (Marseille)   

Défenseurs: Lucas Digne (Everton/ENG), Léo Dubois (Lyon), Lucas Hernandez (Bayern Munich/GER), Presnel Kimpembe (Paris SG), Clément Lenglet (FC Barcelone/ESP), Ferland Mendy (Real Madrid/ESP), Benjamin Pavard (Bayern Munich/GER), Raphaël Varane (Real Madrid/ESP), Kurt Zouma (Chelsea/ENG)  

Milieux: N&apos;Golo Kanté (Chelsea/ENG), Tanguy Ndombélé (Tottenham/ENG), Paul Pogba (Manchester United/ENG), Adrien Rabiot (Juventus/ITA), Moussa Sissoko (Tottenham/ENG)  

Attaquants: Wissam Ben Yedder (Monaco), Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich/GER), Ousmane Dembélé (Barcelone/ESP), Olivier Giroud (Chelsea/ENG), Antoine Griezmann (FC Barcelone/ESP), Thomas Lemar (Atlético Madrid), Anthony Martial (Manchester United/ENG), Kylian Mbappé (Paris SG)

<ami:content>TRANSPORTS - Victime de la fermeture des frontières françaises hors de l’Union européenne et d’un effondrement du trafic aérien en pleine pandémie de Covid-19 , l’aéroport d’Orly va fermer son terminal 4 lundi, jusqu’à nouvel ordre.

Ce terminal sera fermé dans la soirée, indique lundi à l’AFP une porte-parole de l’aéroport d’Orly , confirmant une information du Parisien.

Les compagnies aériennes qui y opéraient seront réorientées sur les deux terminaux d’Orly qui restent partiellement ouverts (2 et 3), précise-t-elle, ajoutant que la date de réouverture n’est pour le moment pas connue. Le terminal 4 avait déjà été bouclé entre novembre et décembre, en pleine deuxième vague de Covid-19 en France. Le terminal 1 reste complètement fermé.

La raison invoquée à cette clôture est la fermeture des frontières françaises alors que depuis le 31 janvier l’Hexagone a bouclé ses frontières aux pays extérieurs à l’Union européenne et aux territoires ultramarins, “sauf motif impérieux”.

Le secteur du transport aérien est l’un des plus affectés au monde par le coronavirus en raison des restrictions de circulation et fermetures de frontières mises en place pour limiter sa propagation.

Le “hub” de Paris-Charles de Gaulle n’a accueilli en 2020 que 22,3 millions de passagers, soit 70,8% de moins qu’en 2019, et l’aéroport d’Orly, 10,8 millions (-66,1%), a indiqué mi-janvier le Groupe ADP.

Il prévoit pour 2021 une baisse de trafic comprise entre 45 et 55% par rapport à 2019.

<ami:content>Photo by Mikey RamirezIt’s hard to estimate design effort. 
Especially in a meeting full of expectant faces, waiting for you to drop a number. We designers get it wrong so many times, we end up adding big buffers just to be safe.

It sucks to get it wrong, but it also sucks to mislead.

We often hear, “Don’t sweat it, knowing how to put up a confident estimate comes with years of experience.” Sure… But still, how do we account for uncertainty?

If you’re in a SaaS company focusing on agile product development, it’s common to have flexible deadlines for deliverables.

But not all projects have the same tolerance. You’ll find those needing coordination between multiple departments, have high revenue impact, that have a launch date set for that big bang… they’re the ones that demand the most predictability.

So Product Designers, here’s how to be less shitty at giving estimates: 
1. How big is the 
Scope?The easiest way to gauge this is by the number of requirements. Keep in mind that it’s often the most vague (least scoped out) requirements that sneak in like a cat with a dead rat. Watch out for those!

2. How 
Complex is the work?If you have mapped out an ideal user journey, look back to it and ask: Does the MVP bypass steps in that journey to make it quicker to build? The more steps it overlooks, the higher chance you have of sacrificing the UX, and overcompensating on the UI. This adds complexity to the designs, which burdens the user.

If you don’t have a user journey map to consult, this may not be the right stage to be creating delivery estimates. Ask for time to do some design discovery.

3. What are the 
Dependencies?Does your work rely on needing information from others? Is the solution dependant on decisions others need to make? What are your blockers?

4. What are the 
Expectations?Timing, quality, the depth of the solution, the fidelity of the design output (wireframes vs pixel-perfect mocks)… If the stakes are high for the project to succeed, you’ll need to be testing and validating a whole lot more before building, meaning a longer design process. If the impact of the work is relatively low, or the work is experimental, there’s a higher tolerance for learning and iterating after shipping.

5. What Skills are required? 
Whether you’re a team of one, or you’ll be assigning the task to another designer — if there is a learning curve, you’ll need to factor in that time. E.g. If your designers have little experience creating personas, think about their speed to learn before they can apply those skills to the task.

Next time you’re invited to a meeting, and know you’ll need to provide an estimate, ask yourself these 5 questions.

If you find yourself ambushed in a hallway, or quizzed over the groan of a coffee grinder, asking them these questions can reset expectations and give you time for a considered answer.

Of course, it’s only when you’re squinting at the details, that the full scale of the problem reveals itself. Until then, apply these tips and hopefully you’ll land not too far from the moon!

<ami:summary>So Product Designers, here’s how to be less shitty at giving estimates: 1.
Timing, quality, the depth of the solution, the fidelity of the design output (wireframes vs pixel-perfect mocks)… If the stakes are high for the project to succeed, you’ll need to be testing and validating a whole lot more before building, meaning a longer design process.

<ami:content>Each weekend, I wake up, shower, and meander over to one of a handful of coffee shops in my neighborhood to write. I take only a blue-ink Bic Cristal pen and a notebook. At work, though, I use an array of apps and software to draft, revise, share, and hand off copy to my colleagues. I’m probably not doing these things in the most efficient way possible, however. I can’t help but wonder (see what I did there?)—what tools do other writers use when drafting copy for web, mobile, and TV?

Here’s a brief rundown of things I use on the regular to write and share product and marketing copy:

Google Docs 
Ever since suggested edits (Google’s version of “tracked changes”) made their debut, my team has used Google Docs exclusively for writing and editing copy. Because everyone at Vimeo has an enterprise account, we’re able to securely share docs with anyone at the company. While I don’t love that we have to grant edit access to someone to allow them to suggest changes, this method is still far better than the save + send + download + edit + save again + send back method we were stuck with before. We create shared folders for projects in which we house all related documents—this could be anything from meeting notes, messaging/positioning docs, launch blog post drafts and social copy, to the actual copy deck that we pass to the designers and developers. This way, it’s easy to find and share docs for any given projects, which makes it easier for us to maintain consistency between the product and marketing copy. It’s also super simple for us to archive these once we close out the project.

Zeplin 
More recently, our design teams across the organization have adopted Zeplin as a means of storing and sharing comps, and passing them off to dev once they’re finalized. The Zeplin files act as a “source of truth” for the entire design/build team, including us writers. This is also a good way for us to keep tabs on any design changes that come through late in the product development cycle. I will often cruise through and make sure no additional copy has been added. If I see a new string, I can comment directly on the design with questions, or the correct wording.

InVisionNow that we use Zeplin to store designs, we haven’t been relying on InVision as much for circulating comps to stakeholders. Nor am I reviewing mocks and giving copy feedback via InVision comments as often as I used to. We still use the service to create interactive prototypes, however. Sometimes, our designers create these to help them gather internal feedback but more often than not, we use them for user testing sessions. InVision prototypes are a great way to give users a feel for the new features and interactions (and copy) you’re developing without investing a ton of time and effort building something that you’re not 100% sure will be effective (and when are you ever that sure???).

Github 
So, I’m a writer. Not a developer. So why am I in Github ? For the same reason all the designers are—we’re often chiming in on tickets to answer questions coming from our product team or our developers. Often, I end up drafting error message strings, etc. directly in a ticket. I also create tickets occasionally. If, as I’m cruising through our site or one of our apps, I discover a string that I did not write, or one that’s been implemented incorrectly in production, I will ticket the error in Github and assign it to the appropriate developer. Each week, I go back through the issues I’ve created and follow up with people until they’re resolved. As UX writers, we’re often the only people keeping tabs on things like proper capitalization, or the separation of “log” and “in.” For this reason, it’s often on us to call out the error, and make sure it gets fixed. If you don’t have access to Github (or Confluence, or whatever system your engineers use), you should definitely ask for an account.

Sketch 
Again, I’m a writer. Not a designer. But I’m constantly working with designers to solve a problem for our users, and to write copy for our various interfaces and interactions. In many cases, I have to download Sketch files to review designs (our designers are now exporting Sketch files directly to Zeplin, rather than constantly saving out PNGs). Sketch is also extremely fun to use, and has way less of a learning curve than Photoshop or Illustrator. It’s easy to create barebones mockups to convey ideas I have for a particular layout or flow—in fact, now I only use Sketch for this instead of Balsamiq.

Thesaurus.com 
For middle-school children attempting to “smarten” up their papers by cramming them with long, highfalutin vocabulary, a thesaurus can be a dangerous thing. But for a professional writer, it’s an essential tool. I don’t turn to a thesaurus as a brain replacement, but rather, as a brainstorming tool. When I’m working on a naming project, for instance, I often need to stare at long lists of words simply to remember what else is out there—often, I’ll see a word on thesaurus.com that reminds me of the actual word I was looking for in the first place. This isn’t cheating, it’s simply what happens when you’re one of a few writers at your company and you‘re lacking someone (or something) to bounce ideas off of.

Grammar Girl 
Achieving proper syntax, impeccable punctuation, and perfect hyphenation is extremely difficult, even for the most experienced word nerds among us. There are thousands of rules we must memorize and sometimes, we make mistakes. It happens. But for experienced writers and editors, we’re more often than not attune to when we aren’t quite sure about something, grammatically speaking. In these moments of uncertainty, just look it up. I often Google grammar rules to double-check myself, even when I’ve known for decades that you should hyphenate 12-year-old, but not “she was 12 years old.” Grammar Girl is my favorite online go-to (because I try not to lug my Garner’s Modern American Usage onto the subway). The Chicago Manual of Style, Purdue Owl, and even random NY Times articles are other resources I reference regularly, and free of guilt.

Moat.com 
This one applies more to marketing and communications copywriters than to UX writers, but if you’re ever looking for advertising inspiration from other brands or companies, Moat is an A+ resource. Type in the name of a brand you admire, or a competitor, and voilà—all of their current and past banner advertisements will appear before your eyes.

Siteinspire.comWhen I’m looking for landing page inspiration—either for copy or design—I turn to a number of different sources. Siteinspire.com , though, is my favorite, by far. It’s simple to browse, and all of the sites it showcases are of a higher caliber than those on One Page Love , and others.

Really Good Emails 
I never thought I’d say this, but I’m sort of a sucker for everything MailChimp creates, at least in terms of resources for writers. If you ever want to compare your transactional, reengagement, onboarding, welcome, or marketing emails to that of other brands, take a spin through the different categories at reallygoodemails.com . (I’m mean, the name alone…)

Moz 
If you’ve ever written page tags and descriptions (which you should be doing, if you’re writing copy for new features and landing pages), you’ve likely Googled “seo best practices.” Moz has some of the easiest-to-follow explanations I’ve found to-date. In addition to their help articles, they also regularly post to their blog. While not all of their writing will appeal to the average UX writer, it is helpful to know, at least, things like ideal character counts, and whether your brand name should come at the beginning or end of a title tag.

Smartling 
In addition to writing copy for web, mobile, and TV in English, I also guide our in-house and Smartling translators. At Vimeo, I wrote both a brief set of style guidelines specific to translation, and also put together a glossary of Vimeo-specific terms, and a chart that defines when we do and not capitalize words, and when we should and should not translate proper nouns (e.g., the names of products like Vimeo PRO). All of these documents are housed in Smartling. And once we submit a set of strings for translation, I hop into Smartling and respond to translator comments to clarify any points of confusion. At some companies, the developers submitting the strings might be responsible for this, but it makes more sense for us, the writers, to be explaining the tone and intention behind the words, as well as the context.

<ami:summary>We create shared folders for projects in which we house all related documents—this could be anything from meeting notes, messaging/positioning docs, launch blog post drafts and social copy, to the actual copy deck that we pass to the designers and developers.
Zeplin More recently, our design teams across the organization have adopted Zeplin as a means of storing and sharing comps, and passing them off to dev once they’re finalized.
This is also a good way for us to keep tabs on any design changes that come through late in the product development cycle.

<ami:content>Le réseau social chinois TikTok va faire l&apos;objet d&apos;une plainte, déposée par Bureau européen des unions de consommateurs (BEUC), avec d&apos;autres associations de consommateurs du continent. Celles-ci lui reprochent d&apos;exploiter les droits et les données des utilisateurs, souvent très jeunes. La Commission européenne sera saisie, afin que soit lancée une enquête sur les pratiques de cette application très populaire de partage de vidéos, indique mardi 16 février l&apos;association française UFC-Que Choisir dans un communiqué.

Entre guerre commerciale opposant Pékin à Washington, et faits divers, la populaire application de vidéos légères est régulièrement pointée du doigt à travers le monde. TikTok avait restreint mi-janvier les paramètres de confidentialité de ses utilisateurs âgés de 13 à 15 ans quelques jours après que des observateurs ont accusé son algorithme de favoriser l&apos;accès à des vidéos sexualisées mettant en scène des mineurs. Les autorités italiennes avaient quant à elles bloqué fin janvier l&apos;accès du réseau aux utilisateurs dont l&apos;âge n&apos;est pas garanti, après la mort d&apos;une fillette de 10 ans en Sicile qui participait au « jeu du foulard » sur le réseau social.

Des pratiques « détestables » 
L&apos;UFC-Que Choisir estime que le réseau social « ne réussit pas » à protéger les jeunes et cite des manquements dans la protection contre la publicité cachée et les contenus « potentiellement dangereux ». De plus, la plateforme accepte les inscriptions à partir de 13 ans, pourtant 45 % des enfants sous cet âge ont indiqué utiliser l&apos;application en France , affirme Que Choisir. L&apos;UFC dénonce également « le système trompeur » des « cadeaux virtuels » visant à récompenser les vidéos préférées des internautes. TikTok « met tout en œuvre pour que l&apos;utilisateur oublie qu&apos;il s&apos;agit d&apos;argent réel », affirme l&apos;UFC, qualifiant ces pratiques de « détestables ».

L&apos;association estime aussi que les données des utilisateurs sont « surexploitées », « contrairement aux obligations des RGPD », le règlement qui garantit aux usagers certains droits sur leurs données. « Très concrètement, TikTok se donne le droit de faire ce qu&apos;il veut des vidéos publiées : les utiliser, les modifier, les reproduire sans que les utilisateurs n&apos;aient leur mot à dire », affirme encore Que Choisir.

Combien de consommateurs européens

Ont-ils déjà compris ce que signifie acheter chinois ? 
Pour l&apos;éviter il faut lire l&apos;étiquette de provenance Made in RPC- tout est dit. 
Evidemment la Chine de Xi Jinping peut aussi commercialiser sous fausse bannière... Ce qui serait encore plus chinois que chinois.

Suppression

Pourquoi n&apos;envisagerait-on pas une suppression d&apos;accès aux réseaux de cette application ?

Quoi d&apos;étonnant ?

Qu&apos;un réseau social chinois n&apos;ait pas plus de respect des libertés et de la vie privée de ses utilisateurs que le régime chinois n&apos;a de respect des libertés et de la vie privée de ses citoyens, en quoi serait-ce étonnant ?

<ami:content>Image from Absurd Design This text is not only for you, dear reader. It is also for me and to the future Designer I intend to be in the next years. Because all the following topics are my learning through my first year working like a Product Designer, but I know that I have to always keep them in mind. In fact, I’m still learning to put them in practice, so I promise to return here always and read again, to remember and keep improving. So let’s go to the topics!

Ask about everything — Don’t be afraid of being critique 
There is a technique in UX Research called “5 Whys” which helps us get to the root cause of a problem quickly or to explore the users’ answers in interviews or testings, for example. Basically you can use this technique asking 5 times “why” a defined problem is occurring.

So this technique is good to understand not only user’s problems, but also to understand the business priorities. When I say “ask about everything” it means asking your stakeholders too. Every time someone come and say we have to work on something, ask “whys”:

- Why is it so important? Do we really have to do it?
- Why are the users being impact? What is the impact? Who are these users?
- Why is it the priority? Which data support this priority?

There are two words that every designer needs to be comfortable saying: “why” and “no.” With every project that crosses your desk, you need to ask “Why are we doing this?” Asking that question is part of the job. “Because I am telling you to,” is not an acceptable answer, and if there’s no answer beyond that, you need to reply with “no.” — Mike Monteiro, “Dear Designer: Your First Job ”.

One year ago I was afraid of being “too critique” asking too many “whys”. But instead I was encouraged to do so, because it is part of my job: to understand the business and the real problem. Here it comes the second topic…

Study Design and really understand about the business 
It’s important to be confident when asking so many “why’s”. In order to increase your confidence it’s necessary trying to really understand the core business of your company. Also how Design can help the company solve problems and grow.

It’s very important to have strong arguments so you can defend your ideas and the importance of researching something before hand. You will face people who don’t see value in the Design process, so the more you know about it and its business impact, the better you can explain and defend your work in the company.

But our work is not only defending the “design process” point of view. Being a defender of this question does not mean imposing our opinion, quite the opposite. It means you have to act like a facilitator sometimes…

Designer is a facilitator 
I’m not the owner of the ideas and I’m not the only person who knows what is right or wrong about an experience. I’m a facilitator and my work is helping guide my team understand the users and also share their ideas about what we have to do. My job is search for data to base our decisions. All design decisions should be based on research and data, not on what I think.

Our work is essentially collaborative and to improve this sense of collaboration in your workplace…

Keep practicing constant feedback 
Here in this topic it doesn’t matter if you’re a designer or not. Our evolution depends on feedback so be open, listen and give feedback to people who work with you. Try keeping feedback as a constant practice between people on your team, because it’s a great way you can progress together.

Seniority is about a behavior — Run from “impostor syndrome” 
Being a “junior designer” doesn’t mean you have to accept orders only. You can assume some responsibilities by asking more questions. Be curious about everything: the product, the business, what people around you do at their routine, who are these people, what are our purpose and so on.

Besides that, don’t go and think you are in the wrong place when you don’t know what to do. You’re not an impostor. Not knowing about how to act or what to do in some situations is not an exclusive “junior designer” issue. After all, being a senior one doesn’t guarantee knowing everything, doesn’t it?

Getting better as a designer means valuing curiosity more than mastery and embracing what you don’t know more than fearing it. — Mike Monteiro, Dear Designer: How You Can Tell You’re Getting Better .

Design less and always write 
Last but not least, this topic is something that I took from this text of Jon Moore: “The Ultimate Guide to Becoming a Great Designer (Part 3 of 3) ”. I really recommend reading all three parts of it.

When we talk about being a designer, everyone will think about interfaces first. But it’s not about it at all. Interfaces are important but before them it’s essential to really understand the problem we are trying to solve, what impact we want to make and how it can help the business’ goals. So it’s about planning, strategies, facilitating ideas and solving problems — with or without interfaces. So thinking that way we shouldn’t “only design” (literally focused on interfaces). We should go beyond that.

Everything should be documented. First, because it’s really important to share with everyone on your company. So write your process, organize ideas, don’t lose data from research. Second, writing is also important to share our learnings with the Design community. By showing our work we can help others while also receiving help from someone who can see improvements, which we were not seeing.

And yes, you do not need to be a senior designer to write about something. Moore wrote:

“Candidly, I felt like a bit of an imposter the first time I wrote about design. Who was I to be waxing poetic about topics my manager had just taught me days before? I didn’t feel like I deserved an audience because I didn’t have the “credentials” to back up my philosophies.

What I’ve discovered about writing is that when you first put pen to paper, you’re writing for yourself. It’s not about your audience, it’s not about claps, and it’s not about landing a book deal.

Writing about design is about reflecting on your beliefs, your technique, and your process”. — Jon Moore: “The Ultimate Guide to Becoming a Great Designer (Part 3 of 3) ”

<ami:summary>Ask about everything — Don’t be afraid of being critique There is a technique in UX Research called “5 Whys” which helps us get to the root cause of a problem quickly or to explore the users’ answers in interviews or testings, for example.
But our work is not only defending the “design process” point of view.
Seniority is about a behavior — Run from “impostor syndrome” Being a “junior designer” doesn’t mean you have to accept orders only.
Not knowing about how to act or what to do in some situations is not an exclusive “junior designer” issue.
